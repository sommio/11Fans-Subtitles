1
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,668
I can't believe those two...

2
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,425
Where are they off loafing around this time?

3
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,599
They damn well oughta bring
back a loaf, that's for sure...

4
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,060
They're finally back, huh?

5
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,984
Hey, where have you two--

6
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,607
Help me...

7
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,779
Hey!

8
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,108
Pull yourself together! C'mon!

9
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,997
We went easy on her 'cause she's a woman,
and she turns around and makes fools of us...

10
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,745
Hey, look.

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,132
Hey, what's the big idea,
barging in here like this?

12
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,174
Who are you?

13
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:22,757
I-I was traveling,
and I came across this abandoned hut.

14
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,387
Cut that out!

15
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,636
Who are you two?

16
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,313
A woman came here, am I right?

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,140
I don't know anything about a woman.

18
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,567
Don't play dumb with us, damn it!

19
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,361
Little lady, if you lie to us, you're gonna
get more than a needle in your eye.

20
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,867
I said that I don't know who
you're talking about, didn't I?

21
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,666
--Let's go.
--Huh? But we haven't...

22
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,913
It's okay.

23
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,665
Big guy!

24
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,337
" Unholy Union (Karmic Justice) "

25
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,642
What's up with this line?

26
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,104
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

27
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,276
Next!

28
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,945
Hey, what do you two think you're doing?

29
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,107
What's this?

30
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,193
What's it look like? It's a Fumi-e,
a picture you step on as a test.

31
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,823
--Do you get it now?
--Nope.

32
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,998
Look, it's a test to determine whether
or not you're a hidden Christian!

33
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,167
If we're clear on that, step on the thing!

34
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,585
No way.

35
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,752
What did you say?

36
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,673
I can't stand being told what to do.

37
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,125
Don't cause a commotion.
Step on it and be done with it.

38
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,461
--Screw that.
--In that case, don't step on it.

39
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,389
If somebody tells me not to step on
something, it makes me want to do it, but...

40
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,090
Quit screwing around!

41
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,676
Take these two away!

42
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,557
You want a piece of me?

43
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:56,142
You're willing to expose the extent of your
stupidity by starting a pointless squabble?

44
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,272
Try to rein in your attempts at self-promotion.

45
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,024
What did you say?

46
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,781
I see that it is time for me to step in!

47
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,782
What the...?

48
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:13,914
To right the wrongs in this land,
I have crossed the seven seas!

49
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:19,795
Yes, I am the man who has been called
God's representative here on Earth!

50
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:24,219
I am the grandson of Francisco Xavier!

51
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,843
Xavier the Third!

52
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,093
What're you--

53
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,052
He's wanted across the country
for interfering with Fumi-e tests!

54
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,306
He is?

55
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,353
Hiyo!

56
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,977
Arrest that man!

57
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,063
To oppose my work...

58
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,861
...is to oppose God's work!

59
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,984
The punishment for which is death!

60
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,837
What the hell was that about?

61
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,630
Don't ask me.

62
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,846
Are you okay?

63
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,019
Thank you.

64
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,145
I don't know what I can do to repay you.

65
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,523
That's okay, you don't need to do anything.

66
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:28,530
I get chased and captured by
guys like those all the time, too.

67
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,163
Actually, I have a couple of would-be
bodyguards to deal with that.

68
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,992
They're useless bums, though.

69
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,668
They always show up too late.

70
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:43,419
They went out for supplies
and still haven't come back.

71
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,091
I'm Fuu.

72
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,011
My name is Yuri.

73
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,054
Um... What is that?

74
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,678
Hm? Oh, this?

75
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,353
Somebody once told me that I
shouldn't show it around too much.

76
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,021
Where did you get that skull?

77
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:04,649
I guess you could call it an heirloom,
or something that someone left behind.

78
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,650
Is this something important?

79
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,073
Try looking into the eyes of the skull.

80
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,286
--What do you see inside?
--An X?

81
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,040
A cross. The Cross of Golgotha.

82
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,167
It's a Christian good luck charm.

83
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,671
They've been handed down
for years at Ikitsuki Island,

84
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,047
the homeland of the hidden Christians.

85
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,629
Ikitsuki Island?

86
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:34,137
It's a little island in Nagasaki province.

87
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:40,518
Yuri, I'm looking for a samurai
who smells of sunflowers.

88
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,976
I wonder if you mean Seizo Kasumi?

89
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,150
You know him?!

90
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,856
Thought you could pull one over on us, did'ja?!

91
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,815
You two bitches tried to make fools of us!

92
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,617
We're gonna pay you back and then some!

93
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:56,037
Hey, don't kill her. We're clear on that, right?

94
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,705
Stop it!

95
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,500
You wanna fight, huh?

96
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:05,126
I-If you don't back off right now, I'm gonna use
my Maiden Swordplay of Certain Death on you!

97
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,221
Hey, wake up, damn it!

98
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,145
You're too late!

99
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,444
You're sure she wasn't pulling one over on you?

100
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,524
She told me. She said that she knew
the samurai who smells of sunflowers.

101
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,031
In any case, it's gotten late.

102
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,033
If we keep aimlessly wandering around,
we'll only end up lost.

103
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,785
But we have to...

104
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,832
Excuse us, did a woman come to this village?

105
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,964
She was being chased by a
couple of fishy guys with guns.

106
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,341
I'm sure you must be mistaken.

107
00:07:54,432 --> 00:08:00,052
If people like that had come here, this whole
village would be in an uproar by now.

108
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,353
You sure you didn't dream the whole thing?

109
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,021
It wasn't a dream!

110
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:10,025
It's late. If you like, please feel free
to stay the night at my home.

111
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,697
Well, I guess we'll take you up on that.

112
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,405
This is odd.

113
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,163
Their security is far too tight for
a village deep in the mountains.

114
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,836
You sure you're not getting
worried over nothing?

115
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,584
I hope you're right.

116
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,956
Hey, are you in here?

117
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,896
Thank you!

118
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,034
Okay, everyone. Please listen.

119
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,988
Up until now, it was believed that you could

120
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,541
gain entry into Heaven
merely by believing in God.

121
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,995
But no more! Oh, what a calamity!

122
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,799
In recent years, Heaven has grown overpopulated.

123
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:59,130
And now, due to the land shortage, it is no
longer possible for just anyone to get in.

124
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:04,969
And so, the passport that will
get you into Heaven is these guns!

125
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,476
It is the the number of these
divine guns that you produce

126
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:13,060
that will decide whether
or not you will enter Heaven!

127
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,065
My words, those of Francisco Xavier's grandson,

128
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,944
are true beyond the shadow of a doubt!

129
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,239
Well, well, what have we here?

130
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,758
What do you think?

131
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:49,187
If these were European imports, they would
cost you somewhere around 20 ryo.

132
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:53,233
But for you, I'll cut you a special deal
and let you have these for 1 5.

133
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,561
I like how you do business.

134
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,568
Consider this the down payment.

135
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,310
Why are you doing this?

136
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,763
What do you hope to get out of it?

137
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,940
Money, of course! Money!

138
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:38,771
Honestly, nothing rakes in
the money quite like religion.

139
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:43,154
Simply mention God's name,
and you can get away with anything.

140
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:47,783
And by working with hidden Christians, I don't
have to worry about being exposed, either.

141
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,662
Truly, I am thankful to God!

142
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,621
Just look at this! Look at my collection!

143
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,048
Shotoku Taishi's dentures! They cost 5,000 ryo.

144
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,251
The three arrows of Motonari Mouri!

145
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:05,589
Complete with certificate of authenticity!
These cost 7,000 ryo!

146
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,050
A folding screen that belonged to the Buddhist
priest Sojun Ikkyu. This was 20,000 ryo.

147
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:13,684
The straw sandals belonging to Nobunaga
that Hideyoshi held to his chest to warm up.

148
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,983
Hideyoshi and Nobunaga!
Two famous names on one item!

149
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,106
They cost me 30,000 ryo!

150
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:25,318
Oh, no matter how much money
you make, it's never enough.

151
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:30,155
And you think that you can buy
my heart with that money, too?

152
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,990
Indeed I do.

153
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:36,124
It seems that poor people don't understand this,

154
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,627
but there is nothing that money cannot buy.

155
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:43,460
Of course, even love can be bought.

156
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:47,593
I am going to make you my wife.

157
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,515
I won't!

158
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:54,141
Do you want to end up the
same way that your father did?

159
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:59,226
You see, the theory goes that if money
doesn't work, there is always violence.

160
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:06,984
What's the matter? Aren't you
supposed to turn the other cheek?

161
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,870
Understand, Momo?

162
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,703
Make sure that you deliver this to those two.

163
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,633
Yuri! Are you all right?

164
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,932
Fuu? What are you doing here?

165
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,681
I will wait until nightfall.

166
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:40,813
Whether today will be the anniversary of your
wedding or your death is entirely up to you.

167
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,159
I can't believe that I got
you mixed up in this, too...

168
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:54,114
No, I came here because I
wanted to ask you something.

169
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:59,373
I have to know. I have to know about
the samurai who smells of sunflowers.

170
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,806
You little furball!

171
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,892
Where have I seen your mug before?

172
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,439
Hey.

173
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,568
Hey, stay out of this!

174
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,317
Isn't this Fuu's pet flying squirrel?

175
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,114
Her pet what?

176
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,114
" Help me --Fuu "

177
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:36,910
More to the point...

178
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,617
...where the hell are we supposed
to go?! That little moron!

179
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:46,754
For us Christians, Ikitsuki Island
was our final sanctuary.

180
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,587
Hidden Christians who had been
persecuted and had nowhere else to turn

181
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,388
began gathering there in large numbers.

182
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,138
My father and I were among them.

183
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:01,895
As was Seizo, who was also known as
the samurai who smelled of sunflowers.

184
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,975
" Police"

185
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:14,032
In the confusion that followed,
my father and I escaped here to this area.

186
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,368
That was the last that I saw of Seizo.

187
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,046
Do you know where he is now?

188
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:29,502
I don't. That happened many years ago.

189
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,804
I don't know if he's still on the island,
or if he died that night.

190
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,015
The next Fumi-e test will be at Shimonoseki.

191
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,973
I'm looking forward to seeing
another entertaining show there.

192
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,857
An over-the-top performance is the best
way to obtain new believers, you see.

193
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,983
Give our best regards to the governor.

194
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,736
What, that whole thing was a sham?

195
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,159
W-Who the hell are you two?

196
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,077
Oops!

197
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,827
We're looking for our companion.

198
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,703
Hey, now!

199
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,503
You're gonna take us to her.

200
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:12,794
Say, you mentioned earlier that you
came here with your father, didn't you?

201
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,052
My father... is dead.

202
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,848
He was killed by that man.

203
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,054
Father was a gunsmith.

204
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:28,109
He had learned that Xavier the Third was
making deals with the local lord in secret,

205
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,155
and Xavier had him eliminated to silence him.

206
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,074
Perhaps... this is our fate.

207
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,822
You're kidding...

208
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:42,033
When I saw a chance, I took it and tried
to escape, but I was captured right away.

209
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:46,790
Maybe this is all a trial meant to test us.

210
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,417
Have you made your decision?

211
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,970
The party is starting!

212
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,013
Now, say it before the eyes of God.

213
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:11,353
Say that you swear to be faithful to me
in sickness and in further illness.

214
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,234
She'll do no such thing!

215
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,407
Are you some kind of idiot?!

216
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:21,284
What do you think you're doing?
Take her away to be executed this instant!

217
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,958
That girl is possessed by a demon!

218
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,002
--A demon?!
--A demon!

219
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,920
Don't! I beg you!

220
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,465
Yuri! Don't listen to what he says!

221
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,260
Listen to what's in your heart!

222
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,100
I won't marry you!

223
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,975
I'd sooner die than become your wife!

224
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,856
What did you say just now?! What did you say?!

225
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,074
Accept your punishment for betraying God!

226
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,116
Don't you dare do it!

227
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:04,743
Foul demons! I'm going to send
you both straight back to Hell!

228
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,415
Fire!

229
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,748
Mugen! Jin!

230
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,296
Who are you?

231
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,715
Hey, you're that nut job from the checkpoint...

232
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,884
So, you're deceiving these believers
with your fraudulent religion

233
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,053
and making money by
selling those illicit firearms.

234
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,053
It's all over! They saw us make the deal!

235
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,259
They what?!

236
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:28,312
--Fraudulent?
--What did he mean, illicit guns?

237
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,639
It can't be...

238
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,601
Do they expect us to believe
the word of outsiders?

239
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,152
It's a lie! It's nothing but slander!

240
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,854
What he said, too!

241
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,362
Shoot, shoot!

242
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,368
I'm over here!

243
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,758
Oh, my God!

244
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,435
Did you see that?

245
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,059
--Hey, he's Japanese!
--It can't be!

246
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,730
So, now we see you for what you truly are.

247
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,937
His claims of being the descendant
of Francisco Xavier were a blatant lie!

248
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:22,867
He was using God's name to exploit
us to make money for himself!

249
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,122
W-Wait, wait! Let's all calm down, okay?

250
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,078
Okay, I might actually be Japanese,

251
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,085
but you said you had been saved
because you believed in me, right?

252
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,510
If that's the case, doesn't that make me
your savior regardless of what I am?

253
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,886
If you're our savior, you're supposed to
be bearing a cross in order to save us.

254
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,092
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I shouldn't have said that.

255
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,973
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry...

256
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,430
I repent, I'm sorry for what I did!
It was wrong of me!

257
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,016
So please, forgive me...

258
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,204
I was kidding!

259
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,251
As if I'd repent so easily, you bunch of morons!

260
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,879
I'm sick of you people and
your God this and God that!

261
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,961
You only turn to Him when it suits you!

262
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:28,175
If you love God so much, then I'll send
the whole lot of you to go see Him!

263
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,308
Amen!

264
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,408
You're going to Ikitsuki Island, aren't you?

265
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,993
Yeah.

266
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:03,130
I'll pray that you will find Seizo, no,
the samurai who smells of sunflowers.

267
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,838
Still, who the hell is this guy, anyway?

268
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,639
It would be easier to find him if we knew.

269
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,137
Well, he's...

270
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:16,598
The sunflower samurai is... He's my father.

271
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,941
Well, goodbye, Yuri.

272
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,269
Farewell.

273
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,025
C'mon, you two! Let's go!

274
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,116
May the grace of God be with you.
