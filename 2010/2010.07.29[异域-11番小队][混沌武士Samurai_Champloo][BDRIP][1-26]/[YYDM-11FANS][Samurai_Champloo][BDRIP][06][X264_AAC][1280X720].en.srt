"The Tokugawa Shogunate's 400th Anniversary"

2
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,927
"The Tokugawa Shogunate's 400th Anniversary"
"This story has nothing to do with that"

3
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:49,233
Having set out on a journey in search
of the samurai who smells of sunflowers,

4
00:01:49,318 --> 00:02:04,746
Mugen, Jin, and Fuu have
at long last reached Edo.

5
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,692
"Stranger Searching (The Red-Haired Foreigner)"

6
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,150
"4th Annual Big Eater Contest Sponsored
by Anago Fukuyoshi and Manpukuji "

7
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,740
We just got to Edo, and we're
already getting a lucky break!

8
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,239
This is really a free, all-you-can-eat deal?

9
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,037
More to the point,
we're going into this thing to win!

10
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,833
We're starving half the time, so this
little event is like manna from heaven.

11
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,878
If it's free, there's really
no need for us to win.

12
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,171
Next, please!

13
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,044
The registration fee. One shu.

14
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,875
What, it's not free?

15
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,926
If we had money, we wouldn't be here.

16
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,348
In that case, it can be anything worth that
amount. If you win, you claim the whole pot.

17
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,299
Got no choice, then...

18
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,387
Fine, whatever! Let's get
this thing started, okay?

19
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,813
What about your samurai friend there?

20
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,064
I'm sorry, but I can't simply hand over
the embodiment of a warrior's soul to--

21
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,816
--Hey.
--Relax, we just need to win,
and you'll get them back.

22
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,896
Hold it!

23
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,027
Just think of it as handing
them over for safe keeping.

24
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:26,738
As hungry as we are, there
ain't no way we're gonna lose.

25
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,369
Okay, let's stuff our faces!

26
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,919
And they're off! It has finally begun!

27
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,672
The annual eating contest,
The Wonderland of Food!

28
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,347
Once again this year, big eaters from all
over the city are here in full force today!

29
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:49,848
The rules are simple.
The contestant who eats the most wins!

30
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,896
The winner will collect all the entry fees,
and our dish is eel rice bowls

31
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:57,977
topped with plenty of that main
ingredient that all Edo kitchens boast.

32
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,936
I, Ichieimon, will be your announcer today,

33
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,192
and since I sell newspaper prints by
reading them aloud, I'm Edo's #1 gossip!

34
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,946
Color commentary will be provided by
Father Ingen, known for his catch phase,

35
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,027
"To hell with vegetarianism! "

36
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,453
It is an honor.

37
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,202
Okay, everyone is now underway.

38
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:16,037
The one to watch out for this year would have to
be Izumi, the winner from the year before last.

39
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:20,374
She seems to be in top form again this year.
What's your opinion, Father Ingen?

40
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,881
Perhaps, but she is the Queen of Sweets.

41
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,553
It remains to be seen just
how long she can keep this up.

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,255
Give me another!

43
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:33,971
And there he goes! This year's favorite,
the man with the bottomless gullet!

44
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,646
Sounosuke of the Mujina tenements!

45
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,225
--I'd expect nothing less
from last year's champion!
--Another!

46
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,982
Incidentally, to show that you give up,

47
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,064
we have a rather well-mannered rule
of putting your hands together

48
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,151
in the traditional gesture of,
" I'm done eating. "

49
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,453
Oh, my! We have a contestant
making the give-up sign already!

50
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,156
This was fast! This was too fast!

51
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,585
Why in the world did this bespectacled
man even bother to come here?!

52
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,752
I am ashamed...

53
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,627
Please... Win back my swords...

54
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,599
At this stage, we're now seeing
a flurry of contestants retiring!

55
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:16,897
This is a veritable survival game!
Who will be the last one eating?!

56
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,816
Don't even think of stopping.
My swords are on the line here.

57
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,901
Eat! Eat, damn you!

58
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,126
Oh, my! Another contestant is down!

59
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,837
That leaves us with only three!

60
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,514
Sounosuke, the man with the bottomless gullet!

61
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,637
Izumi, the Queen of Sweets!

62
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,516
And a newcomer! A mysterious giant!

63
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,768
Oh, I'm sorry! I missed one!

64
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,272
We have one more! We have one more contestant!

65
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,605
And what's more, she seems to
be a young girl of tender years!

66
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,612
Okay, all four of them have started
on their 22nd bowl, last year's record,

67
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,910
at about the same time.

68
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,541
What's this? Have the Queen of Sweet's
chopsticks stopped moving?

69
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,335
An official is going over to her
for verification as we speak...

70
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,004
Could she possibly be--

71
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,753
He's signaling " no good "! She's retired!

72
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,891
Impossible... How could I possibly lose?

73
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:39,688
I won't accept defeat...
I refuse to accept defeat!

74
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,982
How can this possibly be?!

75
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,485
Last year's champion,
Sounosuke, is finally down!

76
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,693
Another! Another! Another!

77
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,496
T-This girl's stomach is a cosmos unto itself...

78
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,074
It's connected to the void of the universe!

79
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,787
A-At any rate, the unthinkable has happened!

80
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,622
These two newcomers are
locked in one-on-one combat!

81
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,174
And what's more, they both have done
what no eater has done before,

82
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,547
and broken the 27 bowl barrier!

83
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,348
Ah, we have finally gotten the personal
data on these two contestants.

84
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,347
Let's see. The young girl's
name is Fuu. Age, 1 5.

85
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,898
As for the large man,
his name is... I can't read it!

86
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:29,275
And do my eyes deceive me? These two
have picked up their pace even more!

87
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,108
The cooks are having trouble
keeping up with them!

88
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,568
Don't underestimate Anago's cooks!

89
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,870
How much food can a human being eat?

90
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,994
Where have we been? Where are we going?!

91
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,043
Their forms are like unto the gods themselves!

92
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,792
Truly awe-inspiring! I am moved beyond words!

93
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,923
It may be that we are now
bearing witness to the very instant

94
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:56,427
that the human stomach evolves
and takes itself to a new level.

95
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,810
Stupid fly!

96
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,979
Oh, my! She gives up!

97
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,399
I don't believe it! She's made the give-up sign!

98
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,193
Here in this coliseum of food,
this holy war of the stomach,

99
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,023
our winner is the large mystery man!

100
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,403
I win!

101
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,906
Yay!

102
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,447
This can't be happening...

103
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,204
Why the hell did you put your hands
together when you were doing so well?

104
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,751
There was a fly!

105
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,670
Who are you, anyway?

106
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,497
Get off my case...

107
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,799
My swords...

108
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,720
Hi! Good afternoon, you people!

109
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,762
Those swords!

110
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,466
Little girl, you put up good fight.

111
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,801
Are you girl ninja?

112
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,011
Huh? No, I'm not a ninja.

113
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,848
Oh, you are not? Then you
should have said so in first place!

114
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,059
Why would I even need to point that out to you?

115
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,897
Is it just me, or does
this guy talk kinda funny?

116
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,154
He does! He sure does!

117
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,780
And do his eyes look blue to you?

118
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,827
They are! They're blue!

119
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,778
You talk nonsense.

120
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,410
And does his hair look red to you?

121
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,910
It is! It's red!

122
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,870
M-My name is Jouji. I am a Japanese.

123
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,376
Do you not believe me?

124
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,003
More importantly...

125
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,257
Those swords are my life.
Will you return them to me?

126
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,962
I won't.

127
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,844
Didn't give it much thought, did ya?

128
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,265
I'm not asking you to return them for free.

129
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,889
--Then... Will you work?
--What?

130
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,437
I want to do Edo sightseeing.

131
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,607
If you be my tour guide,
I give them to you as pay.

132
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,278
Sorry, no can do. We don't
know anything about Edo.

133
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,854
We'll go wherever you want.

134
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,735
Hey, wait a minute!
If you've got time for that,

135
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,191
we could be spending it
looking for the sunflower--

136
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,904
I used to be known as The Edo Tour Map.

137
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,579
You liar.

138
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:51,626
We've received reports that a European
is wandering around here in disguise.

139
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,002
Have you seen anybody like that?

140
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,460
Huh? A European?

141
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,966
I'm not sure... I don't think so.

142
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,924
I haven't seen anybody like that.

143
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,388
" Kaminarimon "

144
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:07,853
Oh! Is this the famous Kaminari Man?

145
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,056
No, this is--

146
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,142
Kaminari Man! So impressive!

147
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,569
Hey, would you say something to the man?

148
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,989
Oh, so this is called Kaminari Man, huh?

149
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,239
That one's Man #1, and that's Man #2.

150
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,035
Wow...

151
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,212
Here you are, sir!

152
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,166
Oh, so this is Edo-style sushi, yes?

153
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,961
Do you have to make such a racket all the time?

154
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,048
I swear, what are their stomachs made of?

155
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,976
Oh, that stings! This is wabi-sabi, yes?

156
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,347
No, that's--

157
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,394
Leave 'em be, leave 'em be.

158
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,563
A European? There was really one here?

159
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:59,899
We received a tip that a man fitting that
description was in the eating competition.

160
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:04,987
Oh, there was a large man about this tall who
talked awfully funny. Is that who you mean?

161
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,696
That's him!

162
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,118
Yay! Tamoyo!

163
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,796
Kagiyo! Yay! Yay!

164
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,930
I swear, I can't believe
how much you two can eat.

165
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,475
I always have room for free food.

166
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:31,680
The sun has set. Surely you've
seen enough of Edo by now.

167
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,891
No, not yet. I see more. There is lots more!

168
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,443
This is great!

169
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,363
Listen up, people! Pay close attention.

170
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,534
We've received a report that a
European is in this restaurant.

171
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,328
Hiding him wouldn't be in your best interest.

172
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,033
Harboring him makes you
an accomplice! Is that clear?

173
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:57,414
When a man talks to me like that,
it puts me in a harboring kind of mood.

174
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,793
What?

175
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,251
What do you think you're doing, punk?

176
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,088
Interfere in police business,
and you'll live to regret it.

177
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,638
Hey! You've got some guts.

178
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:15,599
I almost respect you for that, but it's
in your own interest not to resist.

179
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,150
If I were you, I'd apologize
while I still had the chance.

180
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:23,858
A man talks to me like that,
and I wanna resist even more.

181
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,864
Hey. Gimme that sword on your back.

182
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,115
I do think not.

183
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:32,119
Wha--? This ain't no time
to be stingy, you bastard!

184
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,166
You! You're the European!

185
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,415
Arrest all of 'em!

186
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,292
Whoops!

187
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,594
Let's go!

188
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,615
Damn it! Where'd they go?

189
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,866
What were you thinking?
Why do you have to stir things up?

190
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,623
Guys like that piss me off. I can't help it.

191
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,047
What'll we do if we won't be able
to stay in Edo because of this?

192
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,921
We won't be able to look
for the sunflower samurai!

193
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,593
Geez!

194
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:39,980
" Norieimon Nakamura "

195
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:40,520
Oh! Yamato Nadeshiko! Is this her house?

196
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,567
Of course it isn't.

197
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,362
You do realize that people are after you, right?

198
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,065
This is no time to take in a play.

199
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,197
This is last! This is last!

200
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,405
After I see, I give back your katana swords.

201
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,241
We have no choice, then.

202
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,917
Hey, wait a minute!

203
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,394
--Nakamuraya!
--Norieimon!

204
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,404
How beautiful!

205
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,905
Um, that was--

206
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,906
Ouch!

207
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,613
I love that person! I go to see!

208
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,791
What do you mean, go see? Wait a minute!

209
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,834
Do you think he knows?

210
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,045
No way. You are a man?

211
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,138
Oh, it was a guy under all that.

212
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,806
You didn't know that?

213
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,009
How can this be?

214
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,221
Hey, don't take it out on him!
Come on, cut it out.

215
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:06,194
I... Iike man... even better.

216
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,818
And you are exactly my type.

217
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,029
Will you listen to my story?

218
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:22,120
I am not really a Japanese.
I come here from Holland.

219
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,760
Thou shalt not lie with mankind...

220
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:35,136
In my country, they treat me like deviant.

221
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,309
I was very depressed.

222
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,355
And then, I come across a certain book.

223
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,317
"Great Mirror of Male Love"

224
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,059
The book of Saikaku Ihara of Japan.
"The Great Mirror of Male Love. "

225
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:51,899
The book, it was very shocking.

226
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:57,863
"The path of sexuality is not something that
causes chaotic, carnal desires to gush forth.

227
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,667
Just as with calligraphy, the tea ceremony,
and flower arrangement, it is a means by which

228
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:07,087
a moment of one 's life may be transformed
into an aesthetic, extraordinary time and space.

229
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,292
It is in no way a vulgar thing.

230
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,798
On the contrary, it is a relationship
built on rectitude and respect,

231
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,632
which are also to be found in bushido,
but is even more profound.

232
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:21,220
In the first place, bushido was built
around the solidarity and cohesiveness

233
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,182
of a male group that had expelled all women.

234
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:29,485
They pledge loyalty to their oath brothers,
prepared to lay down their own lives,

235
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,984
and spill their red blood
in the act of ritual suicide.

236
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:37,319
In this respect, the philosophy of bushido has
much in common with the path of male love. "

237
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:43,450
Japan is wonderful!
Wonderful culture of man love!

238
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:49,790
When I read that, I think that Japan
would be country like heaven on Earth.

239
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,346
You! The European and the insolent
bunch who are sheltering him!

240
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,139
Surrender peacefully!

241
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:04,392
Why do you arrest me?
I do not do anything wrong.

242
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,442
Here in our land of the rising sun, even if
dogs, cats, or even worms are allowed to live,

243
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,863
there's no law saying that
foreigners are allowed to!

244
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,157
What insolence! I won't stand for it!

245
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,488
T-They're all Europeans!

246
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,375
You bunch of monsters!
All of you, surrender peacefully, too!

247
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,046
Aw, screw you!

248
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,049
You can kill that one if you want!

249
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:47,264
Mugen! As I promise, I give your sword back!

250
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,814
Jin, too!

251
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,108
--Mugen!
--Yeah, I know!

252
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,617
Wow! Samurai sword fight!

253
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,911
Sir! Please wait!

254
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,177
What's with those guys? Are they the next act?

255
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,227
Samurai!

256
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,809
Damn it, hold it right there!

257
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,359
This is more like it!

258
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,233
Nakamuraya!

259
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,573
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

260
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,415
Can't you see this official order?!

261
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,249
"Scarlet Seal "

262
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,458
That's... the scarlet seal of the Shogunate!

263
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,040
Allow me to inform you
of this man's true identity.

264
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,923
This is the chief merchant of the Dutch
East India Company's Japan branch,

265
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,006
Governor-General Izaac Titsingh!

266
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,888
W-We humbly beg your
forgiveness for our insolence!

267
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,094
What's that mean?

268
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:12,398
That means that he's a special foreigner who
has official dispensation from the Shogunate.

269
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,021
Allow me to introduce myself.

270
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:20,823
I am Sukeemon Tanaka, assigned by
the Shogunate as their interpreter.

271
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,404
Governor-General, we have been
looking for you. Come, let's go.

272
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,082
I... don't want to go.

273
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,502
Governor-General, the day of your
audience with the Shogun is almost here.

274
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,002
We've told him that you had fallen ill.

275
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,210
--I can't stay?
--No, sir, you can't.

276
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,965
I see...

277
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:51,138
I had hoped that I could live
in this country as a Japanese.

278
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:54,019
But I suppose that is not possible yet.

279
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,896
Hey, cheer up.

280
00:19:55,986 --> 00:20:01,982
But eventually, the day will come when
this country will accept people like me.

281
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:06,820
I am sure that this country will
stop being so tight-assed one day.

282
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,077
Who's gonna relax their ass
with you around, buddy?

283
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,874
I want to show you my gratitude.

284
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,795
We didn't really do anything to earn it.

285
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,916
If you'll excuse us.

286
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,087
See ya!

287
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,961
Hey, wait for me!

288
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,008
I want to ask you something.

289
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,882
Yes, what is it?

290
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,010
Do you know anything about a
samurai who smells of sunflowers?

291
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,638
I've been looking for him for a long time.

292
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,970
No, I am sorry.

293
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:37,149
However, it was we Dutchmen
who bring sunflowers here.

294
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,603
Do you have any more clue to go on?

295
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,813
Oh, right!

296
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:47,698
I'm not sure if it's a clue, but I do
have something that belongs to him.

297
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,371
Keep this hidden away.

298
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,832
It is very dangerous thing in this country.

299
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,917
Do not let anyone see it.

300
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,502
Why not?

301
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:08,260
There is only one thing that I can tell you.

302
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,640
If you go to Nagasaki, I am sure
that you will find some answers.

303
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,267
Nagasaki...

304
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,891
Hey, wait!

305
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,523
So, what do we do now?

306
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,650
Isn't it obvious?

307
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,481
Huh? Hey!

308
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,860
"Samurai Champloo Part I, the Edo Chapter
The End "

309
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,235
--Huh?
--Is it?

310
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,864
" Next time,
Part 2, the Nagasaki Chapter starts! "

311
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,455
I wasn't told of this.

312
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,620
"Check it out! "

313
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,886
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

314
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:56,138
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

315
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:01,317
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

316
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,984
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

317
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:12,282
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

318
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:17,204
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

319
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:22,288
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

320
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:27,218
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

321
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:32,511
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

322
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:37,854
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

323
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,934
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

324
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,655
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

325
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:52,030
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

326
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:56,080
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

327
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:04,206
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

328
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:12,548
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
