1
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,599
Kariya.

2
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,938
My goodness, to what do I
owe the honor, Councilor?

3
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:52,359
I take it that you know why I'm here?

4
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,437
I believe I have a good idea.

5
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,568
We are in a race against time.

6
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,825
They say that criminal from the Ryukyus
and that ronin who betrayed the Muju dojo

7
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:08,158
are both swordsmen of considerable skill.

8
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,789
So I have heard.

9
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,251
They also say that they will make
contact with Seizo Kasumi any day now.

10
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,587
It will prove problematic
if they meet up with him

11
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,764
before we eliminate the remnants
of the Shimabara Rebellion.

12
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,092
Councilor.

13
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:31,604
Since you have come all this way, would you
care to take in the flowers of my garden?

14
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,728
I don't have time for
flowers at a time like this.

15
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:41,033
Do you know the proper method
of eliminating weeds, sir?

16
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:46,159
Weeds leech away nutrients that the
flowers need, causing them to wither and die.

17
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,618
That being said, if you uproot the weeds,

18
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,000
you also kill the flowers that are
growing in the same patch of soil.

19
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,625
How do you go about it?

20
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,759
You should plant flowers that will
also use the weeds as nourishment.

21
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:10,597
Flowers such as this one,
whose beautiful exterior belies its brutality.

22
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,354
I've been told that Sara was killed.

23
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,776
If they are skilled enough
to kill someone of her caliber,

24
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:25,452
perhaps this merits drawing my
own sword for the first time in ages.

25
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,325
Excuse me?

26
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,375
I shall see to this personally.

27
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,881
Councilor, begging your pardon, but...

28
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,299
But what?

29
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:43,595
Master Kariya does nothing
but admire his flowers.

30
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:48,767
No one I know has ever seen him draw his sword.

31
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,266
Pardon my saying so, but I'm
not confident that he is capable

32
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,563
of carrying out such an important task.

33
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,265
I see.

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,275
You're young. It's not surprising
that you don't know about him.

35
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,320
Sir?

36
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,616
You ask why he doesn't draw his sword?

37
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:09,618
It's because there are no
opponents worthy of him.

38
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:17,456
Kagetoki Kariya is the kenjutsu master who
was once known as the Hand of the Gods.

39
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,164
He is...?!

40
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:25,346
There probably isn't anyone in this world
who is capable of killing that man.

41
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,260
" Evanescent Encounter (Part 1 )
(The Cycle of Death and Rebirth, Part 1 ) "

42
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:37,729
So anyway, how much farther is it to Nagasaki?

43
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,277
Actually, we've already passed Nagasaki.

44
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:46,404
Ikitsuki Island is a little
to the north of Nagasaki.

45
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,202
Once we cross this mountain,
it will be a stone's throw away.

46
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,031
What the hell? We've been
busting our asses all this time,

47
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,457
and we made it without even knowing it.

48
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,207
We're here, huh? It doesn't seem real.

49
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:03,463
It seemed like we'd never arrive,
but we're finally about to get there...

50
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,841
Maybe, but even if we get to that
Whatchamacallit Island place,

51
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,265
that doesn't mean that we're
gonna find your Sunflower Samurai.

52
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,936
Well, yeah... I guess it doesn't.

53
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,355
Hey, doesn't it seem a little strange?

54
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,529
What does?

55
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,859
I mean, we've been traveling
together all this time,

56
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,787
but we don't know anything
at all about each other.

57
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:36,287
Like what we were doing before
we set out, that sort of thing.

58
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,788
I suppose that's true.

59
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,120
In that case, why don't we take turns

60
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:45,335
and reveal one thing that we've
kept secret about our pasts?

61
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:51,674
'Cause we might not get a
chance to talk about it later...

62
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,930
What's gotten into her?

63
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,557
She's being " centimeter. "

64
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,263
"Centimeter"?

65
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,942
It's a female emotion that they
discovered in Western Europe.

66
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,861
I suspect that she's emotionally worked up.

67
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,360
Are you even listening?
Okay, Mugen, you're first.

68
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,406
Me?

69
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:15,160
I don't really have any secrets or anything.
I've been up to no good my whole life.

70
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,662
We already know that.

71
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,289
Also, I like chicks with big hooters.

72
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,620
We know that, too.

73
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,128
Hey, I know. There was one time when
I got into a fight while I was on the road.

74
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,925
I ended up killing some weird old geezer.

75
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,628
Weird? Weird how?

76
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:34,717
He said something like, " Can you not
see this box with the Shogun's crest?"

77
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:39,271
So I went, " No, I can't, " and I killed the dude.

78
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,894
Hey, now... Wasn't that dangerous?

79
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,604
" Dangerous" is hardly what I would call it.
It's a wonder that you're still alive.

80
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,484
Okay, Jin, you go next.

81
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,736
Begin!

82
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:55,287
What were you doing before
you met the two of us?

83
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,581
I had been traveling for a long time.

84
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,786
I lost my parents while I was still a child,

85
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,965
and was left in the care of
the Muju Shin Kenjutsu dojo.

86
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,633
However...

87
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,098
Ever since I was a child, I had done nothing
but train in kenjutsu day in and day out.

88
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,268
I had always been alone.

89
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:23,440
None of the other children were a match for me.

90
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:28,486
They all feared me, were jealous
of me, and shunned me.

91
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:35,452
Your eyes see too much.
Your strength has no grounding.

92
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:40,578
That means that your strength is strength
that exists for no one but yourself.

93
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,495
Eventually, I was made to bear
the shame of killing my master

94
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,128
and was driven from the dojo.

95
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,804
I was on the road ever since that day,
traveling in search of something.

96
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:59,180
But even I had no idea
what it was that I was searching for.

97
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,389
It may be that I was simply running away.

98
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,858
Now it's your turn.

99
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,786
Ever since I was little,
my mother and I lived by ourselves.

100
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,204
I had always thought that my father
had died a long time earlier.

101
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,961
But as my mother lay sick
and dying, she told me the truth.

102
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:35,591
She said that she was certain that
my father was still alive somewhere.

103
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:40,927
He had left my mother and me
a long time ago and gone somewhere.

104
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:49,443
Mother didn't sound all that mad at him,
but I couldn't forgive him.

105
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:56,276
So I was gonna find him no matter what
and slug him one for my mother.

106
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,906
That's what I decided to do.

107
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,956
But I could never work up the
courage to set out on the journey.

108
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:07,127
And then I met you two at that tea house.

109
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,454
That's when it hit me.

110
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:14,885
I thought, "Something tells me that if I go with
these two, I might just be able to pull it off. "

111
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:22,384
Thanks, you two. Thanks for
coming all this way with me.

112
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,242
Is something the matter?

113
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,075
No, it's nothing.

114
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,750
It's nothing...

115
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,958
Fuu.

116
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:56,385
Once you find the Sunflower Samurai,
what do you intend to do after that?

117
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:04,301
That's a good question. I really
ought to give that some thought.

118
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,512
If I should--

119
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,646
You know, I don't really want
to think about stuff like that.

120
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,024
If you did, that jerk Mugen would...

121
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,441
Sorry... I'm sorry.

122
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,883
Well?

123
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,087
--I-It's them, all right...
--I see.

124
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,344
I wanna kill 'em! I wanna kill 'em soon!

125
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,347
Don't be so hasty.
Hang in there for a little longer.

126
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,355
You there!

127
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:55,151
Do you know who set this
campfire here yesterday?

128
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,853
No idea.

129
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,735
We don't take kindly to outsiders, so go away.

130
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:04,069
Hey! Forget that you saw us, all right?

131
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,870
I guess that just saying that won't do any good.

132
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,935
"Time Flies Like an Arrow"

133
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,938
" In Times of Need,
You Learn Who Your Friends Are"

134
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,124
Wow, look at that!

135
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,205
C'mon, don't answer me with your stomachs.

136
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,508
First things first. Food.

137
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:05,885
Ikitsuki Island?
You'll have to take a boat across.

138
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,512
Here you go. One order of Shabu-shabu.

139
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,436
Whoa, what is this? Meat?

140
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:15,356
It's because this area has
picked up European eating habits.

141
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,651
Hey, is it just me, or is this stuff raw?

142
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,947
Um... You pass it through
the hot water and eat it.

143
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,320
It doesn't take much to cook it.

144
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,117
Hell, I'll try anything once.

145
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,490
Wait just a minute!

146
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,493
Human nature comes out when
you share a single pot like this.

147
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,666
Let me lay down the rules here.

148
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:38,292
Eat in this order.
meat, vegetables, meat, vegetables.

149
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,875
Keep alternating like that, and-- Hey, wait!

150
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,131
Don't start without me!

151
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,346
Mugen, you're eating nothing but meat!

152
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,549
Bite me, pothead.

153
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:53,603
You've got to follow the--
Hey, Jin! You're eating nothing but meat, too!

154
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,557
--Delicious.
--Like I care about the rules.

155
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,767
Survival of the fittest is the way of the world.

156
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,021
This is surprisingly good.

157
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:04,072
Oh, damn it! You two only think of yourselves!

158
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,913
There's one! There's a boat!

159
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,501
I forgot to buy souvenirs!

160
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,295
--Souvenirs?
--Some castella cakes.

161
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,500
--Will you two go buy some for me?
--Now look here...

162
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:29,590
Look, the money's right in here.
Quit your grumbling and get going!

163
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,050
I'll handle the negotiations for our boat fare.

164
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,228
What was that all about? Here.

165
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,819
What can I get you?

166
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:56,245
A criminal from the Ryukyus
by the name of Mugen was here, right?

167
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,576
Who are you?

168
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,912
If you're trying to hide him,
that's fine with me.

169
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:06,547
But one of my men wants to kill
someone so badly that he can taste it.

170
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:12,724
I'm not too sure if I can
keep him under control.

171
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,681
W-Wait a minute! Please! Stop!

172
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,786
I-I don't know if it was him or not,

173
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:40,369
but a man with a strange sword and clothes
said he was going to I-Ikitsuki Island...

174
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,500
Forget that you saw us come in here.

175
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,628
Don't tell anyone. Got it?

176
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,132
I-I understand. I won't tell anyone.

177
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,138
Now that's not nice.

178
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:05,102
Didn't we tell you not to tell anyone?

179
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,949
We just need to buy any damn thing, right?

180
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,781
Yes, but these are rather expensive.

181
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,457
How much is in her purse?

182
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,380
We're about to leave!

183
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,211
Okay, I'll be right there!

184
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,317
Is there a problem?

185
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,736
No, I--

186
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,439
We're leaving!

187
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:56,904
Um... Is your name Seizo Kasumi?

188
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:03,452
I'm sorry. What am I saying?

189
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:07,459
I mistook you for someone else. I'm sorry.

190
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,062
What's the deal?

191
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,486
It's Fuu.

192
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,111
It would've been too hard to say
goodbye, so I'm going by myself.

193
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:41,368
I really enjoyed the talk we had
around the campfire last night.

194
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:46,874
I thought to myself, "I wish
that this could go on forever. "

195
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,297
But then I got scared all of a sudden.

196
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,423
If something happened and we
were split up, what would happen?

197
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,382
Maybe I'd been relying on
you guys too much all this time.

198
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:03,266
Would I be able to make it on my own
once this journey ended and I was on my own?

199
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,018
I gave that a lot of thought.

200
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,521
And that's why I'm going by myself.

201
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,027
Just one last thing.

202
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,235
I know you said that you'd put off
your duel until this journey ended,

203
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,538
but I don 't want you two to kill each other.

204
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,834
The souvenir castella cakes
are a farewell gift from me.

205
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:31,665
Please reconsider your plan
while you're eating them.

206
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,626
Bye. I hope we meet again someday.

207
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,364
I'm looking for someone.

208
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,450
A man by the name of Seizo Kasumi.

209
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,661
I heard that he was on this island!

210
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,713
Do you have a death wish?

211
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,042
No, sir. I'm just looking for someone.

212
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,254
Long ago, this village was peaceful.

213
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,430
If those Christians hadn't come here,

214
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:26,386
our families and homes
wouldn't have been burned.

215
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:31,941
Get out. And don't you ever
speak that name again.

216
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,744
--Come here!
--Look!

217
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,575
Just come here!

218
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:59,051
This person that you're looking for...
Who is he to you?

219
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,215
He's my father...

220
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,888
Oh.

221
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:17,353
On the cape to the north, there's
a house standing there by itself.

222
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,689
Go there.

223
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:25,286
You should hurry. He doesn't have much longer.

224
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,328
Thank you so much!

225
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,289
Thank you!

226
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:43,634
Only hope can give rise to
the emotion we call despair.

227
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:48,639
But it is difficult for man to
live completely without hope.

228
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:54,941
In other words, man has no choice but
to live with despair as his companion.

229
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,063
Who the hell are you?

230
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,817
If you're looking for Kasumi's daughter,
she's crossed over to the island.

231
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,448
You know him, then? You know Seizo Kasumi?

232
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,872
He's a felon who had his soul
stolen by that foreign religion

233
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,496
and abandoned this country.

234
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:18,502
I've heard that he fled here to Kyushu and
was even involved in the Shimabara Rebellion.

235
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:23,677
He's the man that the Shogunate
wants eliminated more than any other.

236
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:30,101
They've also known all along that
his daughter was trying to find him.

237
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:36,103
They've let her run free all this time in order
to discover Kasumi's whereabouts, you see.

238
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:40,812
And now, although it pains me to say it,
I will have to insist that you two die here.

239
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:45,616
Are you here by yourself?
You got a big pair on ya.

240
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:51,156
Come. Don't disappoint me.

241
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,466
Don't be in such a rush, little girl.

242
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,423
I know what it's like...
Life can be such a bitch, can't it?

243
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,510
You travel such a long way,
and it all blows up in your face

244
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,938
right before you reach your destination.

245
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:21,270
That's right, I want him to get
a good taste of that feeling.

246
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,947
I want him to understand how we feel.

247
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,616
W-What are you talking about?

248
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,787
I'm saying that this place will be your grave.

249
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,496
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

250
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,584
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

251
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,809
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

252
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:57,389
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

253
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:02,440
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

254
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:07,691
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

255
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:12,870
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

256
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,537
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

257
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:23,791
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

258
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:28,716
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

259
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:33,846
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

260
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:38,771
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

261
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:44,064
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

262
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:49,407
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

263
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:54,487
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

264
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,208
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

265
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,538
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

266
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,591
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

267
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:15,764
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

268
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:21,769
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
