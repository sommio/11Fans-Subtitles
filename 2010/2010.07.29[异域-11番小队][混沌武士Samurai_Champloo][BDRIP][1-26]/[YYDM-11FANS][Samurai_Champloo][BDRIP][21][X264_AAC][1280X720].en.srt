1
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,758
It's not my eyes that can see them.

2
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:53,694
To tell you the truth, I had hoped
that this day would never come.

3
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,022
I wished that this journey would go on forever.

4
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,904
But that was too much to ask for.

5
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,826
Who are you?

6
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,227
" Elegy of Entrapment, Verse 2
(Lamenting the Evils of the Times, Verse 2)"

7
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:40,574
Maybe we should wait here for a bit.

8
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,619
Jin might come back.

9
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,788
He's not gonna come back unless
he tries to make a move on her

10
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,615
and she kicks him in the nuts.

11
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,120
I wish you'd get serious for once.

12
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,453
Look who's talking.

13
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:56,756
Geez, do you wanna find that sunflower
samurai guy or don't you? Let's get moving!

14
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:02,300
This is terrible! Something
terrible's happened, everybody!

15
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:06,600
The bridge! The rope bridge
outside the village has fallen!

16
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,927
It's what?!

17
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,727
Was anyone on it?

18
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,272
Just come on!

19
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,270
Weren't those two headed in that direction?

20
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,976
You don't think that they--

21
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,452
Sara was carrying those!

22
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,406
Somebody was on the bridge?

23
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,912
Nobody could've survived
a fall from that height.

24
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,742
It can't be...

25
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,256
I found somebody!

26
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,058
She's still alive!

27
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,431
Sara...

28
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,108
Jin... Where's Jin?!

29
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,527
Did you see anyone else? A man?

30
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:04,199
No. When I got here, there was just that woman.

31
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,570
Hey, don't go down there!

32
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,905
--Mugen!
--Shut up!

33
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,216
What are we gonna do? There's no sign of Jin...

34
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:29,721
That moron can't see a
damn thing without these.

35
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,016
Those are for show.

36
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,692
Now, now, there's no cause to worry.

37
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,645
Oh, thanks for your help.

38
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,028
Luckily, her injuries don't look too serious.

39
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,485
Go ahead and rest up in this shack for a while.

40
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,571
Thank you so much.

41
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,920
Mugen! Hey, wait!

42
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,355
Sara...

43
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:30,278
I'm sorry. If only I hadn't
asked him to come with me...

44
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:38,290
I could say the same thing.
If only I hadn't told him to go with you.

45
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,798
Do you still...

46
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,969
Do you still intend to go to
Nagasaki, no matter what?

47
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,593
I'm going. No matter what.

48
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,933
Oh.

49
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,575
Mugen! Sara's regained consciousness.

50
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:20,836
Take over for me, okay?
I'm gonna go look for Jin!

51
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,973
I found these in the river.

52
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,184
They're the tools of your trade, ain't they?

53
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,860
I'll be waiting at the riverbank.

54
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,384
I have nothing against you personally.

55
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:24,061
This is the only life that is open to me.

56
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,648
My son's life is at stake.

57
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,908
Show me what you've got.

58
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,325
I wanna see if you really killed him.

59
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,672
Looks like I don't need to hold anything back.

60
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,695
You bitch!

61
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,158
Shit!

62
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,673
Don't need to hold back? Who am I kidding?

63
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,802
I've crossed swords with all
kinds of people over the years,

64
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,474
but you're in a league of your own, lady.

65
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,395
I never fought anybody like you before.

66
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,231
And that's fine by me!

67
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,570
What was that?

68
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,801
Mugen!

69
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,312
What's going on?! What are you doing?!

70
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,479
Who the hell are you?!

71
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,896
Even though I can't see you,
I can still sense it.

72
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,526
Say what?

73
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:40,657
Powerful hatred and rage swirl within you.

74
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,955
They are so powerful that I can't tell
whether or not it's actually sadness.

75
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:51,417
It's as if you've never been loved by anyone.

76
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,171
It's as if... you're like me.

77
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,379
Are you telling me that you know
how I'm gonna come at you?

78
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,513
What a load of crap!

79
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,809
Please, stop!

80
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,978
Just stop it!

81
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,564
--Mugen!
--Stay back!

82
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,319
Stay away!

83
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,662
No!

84
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,662
Don't! Don't kill him!

85
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,926
Come back here! Hey!

86
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,928
Come back here, bitch!

87
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,220
Careful, now. You shouldn't try to get up yet.

88
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,797
Who are you?

89
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,726
Isn't it obvious? I'm the
man who saved your life.

90
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,722
What?

91
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,146
At any rate, you're the first
person I've met in a long time.

92
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,894
Take it easy.

93
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,398
There's something that I must--

94
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:42,858
Don't be in such a rush. Humans need
to eat to build up their strength.

95
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,694
Want some?

96
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,120
I am in your debt.

97
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,164
You can't have any.

98
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,577
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

99
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,539
I'll leave it over here, so you get it yourself.

100
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,075
You fell for it! You fell for it!

101
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,158
Why are you tormenting me like this?

102
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,587
You've healed up enough to
make it that far, didn't you?

103
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,667
I'm joking, I'm only joking.
I'll get you something to eat.

104
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,629
I guess I'll go catch you
some fish or something.

105
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,635
Come on, hold still.

106
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:56,644
Forget it! This scratch will heal by itself!

107
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,270
Geez...

108
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,588
You're well enough to be up and about, huh?

109
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:28,088
Do you know where a fish's eyes are?

110
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,514
The eyes of a fish?

111
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,341
In the water.

112
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:37,557
A fish knows what's happening around it by
the flow of the water that surrounds its body.

113
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:43,270
If you go against the flow of the water, the
fish senses it at the last minute and gets away.

114
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:48,199
But if you don't fight the current and let
your body move with the flow of the water...

115
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,576
Oops.

116
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,627
Well, sometimes they get away.

117
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,387
Hey, let's just give up.

118
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:17,471
I mean, if I lost you, too,
I don't know what I'd--

119
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,430
That woman...

120
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,892
Her guard is completely up,
but there's no malice in her, either.

121
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,280
Next time, I might really buy it.

122
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,325
Thank you for all your help.

123
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,250
You're leaving?

124
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,250
That's too bad, I was hoping
to have more fun with you.

125
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,706
I can't.

126
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,258
Here's a souvenir for you.

127
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,462
I will take your wise teachings to heart.

128
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,796
Teachings?

129
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,850
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day.

130
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,519
Teach him how to fish,
and you feed him for a lifetime.

131
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,767
It is an old Chinese proverb.

132
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:06,103
You say the craziest things.
I didn't teach you anything.

133
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,698
You never told me your name.

134
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,118
Musashi Miyamoto.

135
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,828
I'm lying, I'm lying!
I couldn't possibly be him!

136
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,206
You can call me Johnny.

137
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,036
Johnny...?

138
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,381
Stop by again sometime.

139
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,768
What's made you lose your composure?

140
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,397
Did you become attached to them?

141
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:49,400
Surely you haven't forgotten.
Your life is not your own.

142
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:55,527
Do you remember that your
son's life is in your hands?

143
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,282
Yes.

144
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,332
What's the matter?

145
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,460
Nothing.

146
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,793
Make sure that the job is finished by tomorrow.

147
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,898
A g-g-ghost!

148
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,357
Are you hungry?

149
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,659
I've been worried sick about you, and the best
you can come up with is, "Are you hungry?"

150
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,613
Even a ghost would have
something more thoughtful to say.

151
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,245
That's what you get for trying
to hog all the fun for yourself!

152
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,667
Hey, what are you talking about?

153
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,461
You went off by yourself with her
because you knew damn well

154
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,836
that she was trying to kill us.

155
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,838
What's become of her?

156
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,511
That lady is one serious badass.

157
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,180
I see...

158
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,803
Jin...

159
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:08,475
It's likely that we've been
thoroughly investigated.

160
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,437
She was ordered by someone to befriend us.

161
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,866
She said something about
her kid's life being on the line.

162
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:21,788
Hang on. If that's true, doesn't it
mean that Sara's being used, too?

163
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,284
Do you have any idea who it could be?

164
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,118
We've skipped out on our restaurant bills,
snuck through a checkpoint, and killed people.

165
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,873
Take your pick.

166
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:32,424
I find it hard to believe that anyone would
hire an assassin of her caliber over that.

167
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,216
True enough.

168
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,509
I guess not...

169
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,963
Well, whoever it was who sent her,

170
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,141
if she's trying to kill us,
she'll show up again soon enough.

171
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:02,571
That woman can see our moves
a split second before we make them.

172
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,371
Sure looks that way.

173
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,001
A fish...

174
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,457
A fish knows what is happening around it by
the flow of the water that surrounds its body.

175
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,634
Don't fight the current.
Let your body flow with it.

176
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,838
If you do that, you might
be able to grab the fish.

177
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,594
Where'd you hear that?

178
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,176
It's something I picked up
from the man who saved my life.

179
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,943
Well, if this is the only life open to you...

180
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,947
...then I'll do what has to be done.

181
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:59,256
Do you still intend to go to
Nagasaki, no matter what?

182
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,803
I see.

183
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,930
Mugen!

184
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,894
Shit!

185
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,466
Don't fight the current.
Let your body flow with it.

186
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:44,138
If you do that, you might be able to catch her.

187
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,517
Why'd you do it? Why'd you hold back?!

188
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:43,152
You could've killed me!

189
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,075
I figured it out today.

190
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,949
My son died a long time ago.

191
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,461
I was just being used.

192
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,708
Then why--

193
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,213
I can't fight them. They're the government.

194
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:09,386
I want you to live, Mugen.

195
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,496
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

196
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,584
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

197
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,809
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

198
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:57,389
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

199
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:02,440
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

200
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:07,691
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

201
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:12,870
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

202
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,537
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

203
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:23,791
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

204
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:28,716
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

205
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:33,846
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

206
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:38,771
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

207
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:44,064
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

208
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:49,407
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

209
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:54,487
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

210
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,208
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

211
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,538
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

212
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,591
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

213
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:15,764
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

214
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:21,769
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
