1
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,959
" U ra-Edo "

2
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,507
When one reflects on the past,
regardless of culture,

3
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:42,262
it is during periods of idleness
that fashion is cultivated and born.

4
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:48,598
Yes, even the threadbare casual style
was born here during the Edo Era.

5
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:55,609
And designs resembling street fashion
had already arrived on the scene.

6
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,198
"Aki Province "

7
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,113
"War of the Words (Master of Pen and Sword)"

8
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,120
I think I'll try cod roe
and mochi cheese in mine.

9
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,872
Coming right up!

10
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,091
" Hiroshima-yaki "
"Ju-ju "

11
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:57,503
So, what are you guys getting?

12
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,800
Seafood style. With oysters.

13
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,344
You got it. And you, buddy?

14
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,342
Gimme what this guy's having.

15
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,593
Coming right up.

16
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,677
You keep ordering the same thing as Jin or me.

17
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,353
You can eat whatever you want, you know?

18
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,146
I don't got much choice.

19
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,065
But everything's written there
on the menu, plain as day.

20
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,440
That's my point. I can't understand it, okay?

21
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,365
Are you telling me that you can't read?

22
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,193
This one here is " no. "

23
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,495
So's this one. And this one, too.

24
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,322
See, I can read just fine.

25
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,410
What's this one, then?

26
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,335
--" No, " I guess.
--It's " me. "

27
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,584
You little bitch, that was a trick question!

28
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,338
Are you telling me that you
can only read one letter?

29
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,546
Being able to read one is
more than enough, you know?

30
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,599
Now that you mention it,
I've never seen you read anything before.

31
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,428
I can get by just fine
without being able to read.

32
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,059
Isn't it amazing that in all the time
we've been traveling together,

33
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,812
we've never noticed that he can't read?

34
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,893
Hey, you just laughed, didn't you?!

35
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,856
Listen up, you don't need to
be able to read to kill people.

36
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,868
What's that crap you're spoutin', boy?!

37
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:11,540
It's okay for a fool to stay a fool, huh?
Don't give me that pathetic garbage!

38
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,081
Listen good!

39
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,880
Every word has a soul in it!

40
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:23,586
If you don't know the letters that convey
that soul, you're the one who loses out.

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,922
When you're illiterate, you're
automatically branded as an idiot!

42
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,008
Don't that piss you off, boy?!

43
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,558
Well?! Don't it?!

44
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,510
Are you okay with bein' an idiot?!

45
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,312
Are you?!

46
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,313
He passed out...

47
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,774
Let's see... How much do we owe?

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,656
D'oh! We're short!

49
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,612
Put it on this old dude's tab, okay?

50
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,743
--Sure thing!
--What? But...

51
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,450
Don't sweat it. Call it a nuisance fee.

52
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,580
Let's go.

53
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,582
Sorry, mister!

54
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:03,463
Mister? C'mon, wake up. Time to settle up.

55
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,384
All together, it comes to 1 3 shu.

56
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,679
What the hell is this?!

57
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,182
We keep painting it over
and over... It's a vicious circle.

58
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,358
They're getting awfully cocky.

59
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:25,030
Um, pardon me, ladies.
Do you know who painted this?

60
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:29,234
Of course we don't! If we did,
we would've had 'em arrested ages ago!

61
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,285
I-I see...

62
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,115
I'm sorry, but there is someone over
in Mihara to whom I am indebted,

63
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,701
so I would like to stop by and pay my respects.

64
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:42,210
Mihara's pretty far away from here.
Who would you be willing to go that far to see?

65
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,461
An old girlfriend?

66
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,384
To anyone who aspires to
mastery of the martial arts,

67
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,963
Mihara is a town that cannot be passed by.

68
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,891
Among all the town's dojos, the best one in
which to study general weapons mastery...

69
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,514
is Gojuu Hall.

70
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,220
Under the tutelage of
Master Junosuke Niwa, I once--

71
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,226
Fine, go have fun!

72
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,356
And make sure you ask him if he knows
anything about the sunflower samurai, okay?

73
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,610
Hey, deep down, you really want
to learn how to read, don't you?

74
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,569
Just drop it.

75
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,495
I'll teach you.

76
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,826
Look, that's "sa, " and " n, " and " jou. "

77
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,878
That means "was here. " Got it?

78
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:26,083
That's the bastard who stiffed me yesterday...

79
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,887
What the heck does 4-6-4-9 mean?

80
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,520
Oh, it's "yoroshiku"!
" Nice to meet you "! Get it?

81
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,098
Huh?

82
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,191
"Gojuu Hall "

83
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,204
Who the hell are you?

84
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,038
What do you think you're doing here?

85
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,341
Sorry, pal, but this is our team's turf.

86
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,467
Listen up, pops. I think we're gonna
collect a little relaxation fee from you.

87
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,804
He's telling you to hand over your money!

88
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,269
--S-Stay away!
--S-Stay away!

89
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,936
This is a place where those who strive
to master the martial arts gather together.

90
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,273
This is no place for the likes
of you to be loitering around.

91
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:36,453
Sorry, mister. But the thing is,
this is our hideout.

92
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,621
Where might I find Master Niwa?

93
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,369
Master Niwa?

94
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,703
Oh, if you mean the bosses,
they're in town right now.

95
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,334
What?

96
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,470
Darn that Mugen... He's always
disappearing into thin air.

97
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,933
--I'm the boss!
--No way! I'm the boss!

98
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,480
Is that how you show your
respect towards your elder brother?!

99
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:10,312
You were only born one stinkin' minute
before me, so don't pull that big brother crap!

100
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,075
You think that a guy who can't keep
junior and senior rankings straight

101
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,574
is cut out to be the boss?!

102
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,281
What do you think this is,
some procession of feudal lords?

103
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,287
That way of thinking is so behind the times!

104
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,290
Just looking at that face
of yours pisses me off.

105
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,339
You took the words right outta my mouth.

106
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:33,010
What're they talking about?
Their faces are identical.

107
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,882
--Who talked just now?!
--Who talked just now?!

108
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,278
--Pretty...
--Pretty...

109
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,525
Stop copying me!

110
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,857
You' re the one who's copying me, you dick!

111
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,744
Those big brown eyes are so cute!

112
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:00,741
You're wrong!

113
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,165
The way her mouth is a
little coy is seriously sexy!

114
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,163
Goodness.

115
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,745
And that voice like a bell is so sweet!

116
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,080
No way!

117
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,884
The way her little nose is turned up
just a little bit is so honey-bunny!

118
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,801
Hey, you two!

119
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,221
--She's mine.
--She's mine.

120
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,722
It's been a long time.

121
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,520
Tatsunoshin. Kazunosuke.

122
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,725
--It can't be!
--Big bro Jin...!

123
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,559
You know these two?

124
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,490
That hurt!

125
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,784
Just who the hell are you?!

126
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,034
My name is Bundai.

127
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,532
" Private School Bundai Hall "

128
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,282
This here is a private school.

129
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,835
And under this roof,
you will address me as Sensei!

130
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,255
You're a teacher?

131
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,335
You can keep trying to solve all your
problems by force the way you're doing now,

132
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,262
but that won't stop the world from turning.

133
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,262
You can't build a castle if
all you've got is carpenters.

134
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,594
What you need is a wood plane.

135
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,224
And even if you've got wood planes,

136
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,852
you'll get hurt if they aren't
kept good and sharp at all times.

137
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,308
First, you sharpen your plane.

138
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:19,818
" Better to burn out than fade away"
" Let's get outta this town "

139
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,237
I'm about to teach you how to read.

140
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,318
" Drills"

141
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,362
Doesn't it piss you off?!

142
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,745
To have your companions mock you like that?!

143
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,005
Are you kidding me?! You can't read?!

144
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,883
" No "

145
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,260
All right, damn it, you're on!

146
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,015
Why do you quarrel with one another?

147
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,267
As brothers, should you
not be helping one another

148
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,601
and mastering the path that
your father handed down to you?

149
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,061
What do you expect?

150
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,614
Nobody takes over as heads of families or
follows in their father's footsteps these days.

151
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,316
Hell, when somebody offs themselves,

152
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,493
they're only screwing over
the ones they're leaving behind.

153
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,322
Besides, the way this guy dresses scares people.

154
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:11,035
Come back and try saying that again after
you've washed that filthy mug of yours!

155
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,244
Say what?!

156
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,579
You want some, pinhead?

157
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,754
Enough of this.

158
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,334
If this is the case, settle the matter with
swords like true heirs of Gojuu Hall.

159
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,795
--We're no good with those.
--We're no good with those.

160
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:28,135
In that case, what could act as a
substitute for a sword for the two of you?

161
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,392
--That'd be...
--Yeah, definitely that.

162
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,972
Your graffiti?

163
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,025
That's not quite right, bro.

164
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,481
It might look like ordinary graffiti to you, but
it's something that we've devoted our lives to.

165
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:44,284
So in that sense, it's no different from
the way Pop devoted himself to the sword.

166
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,534
It's called tagging, and it's like
it proves that we're alive.

167
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,240
That ain't right.

168
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,576
We try to tag the most dangerous places.

169
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,077
" Police"

170
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,794
Places that nobody else
has ever tagged before.

171
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,414
" Live in the Moment"

172
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,632
It's like the only time we're really alive
is when we're experiencing that thrill.

173
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,176
They're both saying pretty
much the same thing, huh?

174
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:08,433
Okay, then. You should duel each
other using this tagging of yours.

175
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,679
--How do we do that?
--How do we do that?

176
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:13,889
You could say that the winner will be the one
who tags the most dangerous place, right?

177
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,396
--In that case...
--The prize has to be...

178
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,354
Oh, goodness... Whatever shall I do?

179
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,986
--Bro, please act as the judge!
--Bro, please act as the judge!

180
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,447
What's this one?

181
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,904
It's "re. "

182
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:39,416
" Be a woman! "

183
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,507
This one with the swoop
on the end, that one's " re"!

184
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,380
How many times do I gotta explain it?!

185
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,427
This is so damn confusing!

186
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,178
What's the matter, my good first grade pupil?

187
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,137
Are you crying uncle? Are you?
Are you gonna turn tail?

188
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,974
The way all these letters look
so much alike pisses me off!

189
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,811
If you've got complaints to make, I'll listen
to 'em after you've passed these drills!

190
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:08,030
This is awfully unusual for you, isn't it?
Acting as a mediator all of a sudden...

191
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,785
I mean, this is just a simple
brawl between brothers, right?

192
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,710
Their father, the man I am indebted to,
once asked something of me.

193
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,467
There is now nothing more that I can teach you.

194
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:37,397
Return to your master and walk
our path with your head held high.

195
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,019
Yes, sir.

196
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,772
I have a favor to ask of you.

197
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:47,358
If anything should ever happen to me,
I ask that you look after my sons.

198
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,032
--C'mon, Kazu!
--Wait up, Tatsu!

199
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,738
Tag!

200
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:59,874
" Niwa Family"

201
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:09,547
This is a surprise... Do you remember me?

202
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,756
It has been a long time, sir.

203
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,435
--I see you've grown into a fine young man.
--Not at all.

204
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,228
My, what fine flowers you've placed there...

205
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,398
They're just wild chrysanthemums
that I found over there.

206
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,977
No, it is the thought that counts.

207
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:28,406
I'm sure that Master Niwa
is smiling beyond the grave.

208
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,244
What was it that happened?

209
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:38,542
Of all the earthly emotions of men,
jealousy may be the most powerful.

210
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:43,543
There was no dojo in the area
that surpassed Gojuu Hall.

211
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,545
The masters of the other dojos
curried favor with the local lord

212
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,843
and made false accusations against Master Niwa.

213
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:54,095
He was ordered to either close his doors
and take down his sign or cut off his own arm.

214
00:14:54,185 --> 00:15:02,183
And so, in order to leave the dojo to
his sons, he committed ritual suicide.

215
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:07,316
But his young sons were unable to
appreciate their father's strength

216
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,774
and learn from his example.

217
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,156
With the way those two are behaving,
his memory will never be respected.

218
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,548
" Re "! " Ne "! " No "! " Me"!

219
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,048
"A"! " O "!

220
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,130
All questions answered correctly!

221
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,261
Damn straight. What else did you expect?

222
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,219
And now, use the letters you've
learned to write your own story!

223
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,055
Write it bigger than anybody else!

224
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,687
--Got it?!
--Hell, yeah!

225
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,235
Hey, where the heck have you been?!

226
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,281
Oh, around...

227
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,328
Geez, we've got a serious situation here!

228
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:01,408
Two men who are vying for my attention
are fighting each other at this very minute.

229
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,117
Sounds rough, all right.

230
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,704
Um... I think they called it
jogging or something.

231
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,508
It's a life-or-death struggle using letters!

232
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,381
Letters, you say?

233
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,634
Stop! Police!

234
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,315
--Police!
--Stop in the name of the law!

235
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,229
What the hell is this?

236
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,367
This is terrible! Somebody, help!

237
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:00,763
The reds... The blues... How lovely.

238
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,184
I got you beat!

239
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,556
You wish!

240
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,060
No, you wish!

241
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,232
The duel will never be settled at this rate.

242
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,483
Well, is there anywhere that
you haven't put graffiti on yet?

243
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,813
Well...

244
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,819
Yeah, there's one.

245
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,866
--Hiroshima Castle!
--Hiroshima Castle!

246
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,549
Hold it!

247
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,803
Come along peacefully!

248
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:58,609
"Okonomiyaki "

249
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,324
They're getting revenge in their own way.

250
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,654
The revenge against the lord that
their father was unable to get himself.

251
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,509
It's wrong! They should be ashamed!

252
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,264
I know what you mean.
Kids these days don't have any respect.

253
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,891
You're writing it wrong!

254
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,099
Magnificent...! This is
what I've been looking for!

255
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,401
Who the hell is that?!

256
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,326
Come back here!

257
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,015
I'm number one!

258
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,861
So, who won the duel?

259
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,440
Neither one of us. Somebody beat us to it.

260
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,400
We got beat by some mystery man.

261
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,614
It's a big world. There's always
somebody better than you.

262
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,919
What is important is that you
have learned that lesson.

263
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,461
Then I guess nobody wins me, either.

264
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,539
--Let us cop a quick feel before you go!
--Let us cop a quick feel before you go!

265
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,625
Huh? Hey, now!

266
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,553
She's so cute!

267
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,513
Awesome! Just look at those round eyes!

268
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,065
--She's so soft!
--What's up with that?

269
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,813
I recognize your talent for what it is!

270
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:04,651
You must be the tagging team
that has this town all abuzz.

271
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,110
What if we are?

272
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,197
Who are you people?

273
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,701
How delightfully cool!

274
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,205
Boys, I will make you famous!

275
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,253
You boys have it in you to become designers

276
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,083
who will breathe fresh air
into this stagnant industry!

277
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,761
I just know it!

278
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,804
So, who are you?

279
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,224
The textile merchant who
is known to all in Ura-Edo.

280
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,599
I am Uhori from the Ando Store.
A pleasure, I'm sure.

281
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,147
Nothing doing.

282
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,520
Before that, you do have
something else to see to!

283
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,444
You've been writing everything wrong!

284
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,396
--Aw, Teach!
--Aw, Teach!

285
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,075
You're gonna hit the books first! Got it?!

286
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,777
Are you serious?!

287
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,658
Come back!

288
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,825
What's the matter?

289
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,376
This one! And this one, too!

290
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,416
"Sandal "
" Fuu's"

291
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:58,503
What's going on here?!

292
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,496
"Animal "

293
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,338
Hey, you jerk!

294
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,294
What's the meaning of this?

295
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,881
You gotta write your name
on your stuff, you know?

296
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,182
That symbol--

297
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,261
" Mugen, " it means " infinite. " I made it myself.

298
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,596
Wait, don't tell me that
the man last night was--

299
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,066
" Ura-Edo "

300
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:19,524
Later, when the two young men traveled to Edo,

301
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,524
they blew a breath of fresh
air into the fashion world,

302
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:27,735
and their designs spread from
Ura-Edo Avenue to all across the country.

303
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,485
" Niwa "

304
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:33,285
And people came to call these
two men "The Embodiment of Graffiti. "

305
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,616
To be continued!

306
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,954
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

307
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:44,042
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

308
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:52,267
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

309
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:56,847
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

310
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:01,897
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

311
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:07,149
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

312
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:12,328
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

313
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,995
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

314
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:23,248
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

315
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:28,174
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

316
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:33,304
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

317
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:38,229
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

318
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:43,522
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

319
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:48,865
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

320
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:53,945
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

321
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:58,666
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

322
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:02,995
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

323
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,049
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

324
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:15,221
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

325
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:20,601
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
