1
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,135
What the heck are you two doing?

2
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,134
What about your promise not to kill each other?

3
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,591
This just means that no matter
how hard we try to split up...

4
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,888
...it was always meant to turn out like this!

5
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,182
" Hellhounds for Hire (Part 2)
(Tacit Understanding)"

6
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,775
Wait a minute! Hey!

7
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,871
Hey!

8
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,077
O-Suzu! Let's get out of here!

9
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,380
Hurry! O-Suzu!

10
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,924
I...

11
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,626
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,062
How dare you do this to O-Suzu?!

13
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,235
Think you can do something about it?

14
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,779
Damn it...!

15
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,495
That's enough!

16
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,703
I knew that you two would come.

17
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,131
What the hell are you
guys doing?! Stay outta this!

18
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,338
I'm the one who's gonna kill him!

19
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,388
Outta my way!

20
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,437
H-He's one of ours! Are you crazy?!

21
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,942
Hey!

22
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,992
Restrain yourself for now.

23
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,914
If you lay down your life now, the person
you're trying to save will be lost, too.

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,116
Damn it!

25
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,167
Come back here, you bastard!

26
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,834
You should get rid of that
lunatic right away, Boss.

27
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,511
That man even cuts down his own allies...

28
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,260
I think it's for the best, actually.

29
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:51,061
It was a fine opportunity to let our
own men see what he's capable of.

30
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,231
B-But... But, boss!

31
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:58,151
If you truly want to rescue her, your only
option is to crush the Nagatomi Gang.

32
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,945
Their loyalty is bought with money.

33
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:05,116
I don't think that any of them would
willingly risk his life for their boss.

34
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:09,697
Take their boss' head, and the
organization will most likely crumble.

35
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:14,205
Learning that fact alone makes
our infiltration worthwhile.

36
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,047
I swear, we did terrible business today!

37
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,976
You girls had better start
pulling in some money tomorrow!

38
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,353
Let's come up with a way to escape, okay?

39
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,319
It's no use.

40
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,988
I can't run away.

41
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,690
Why not?

42
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,620
If I ran away from here,
my father would be killed.

43
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,618
But... you don't want to do this, right?

44
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,123
Anyway, how come a daughter
has to shoulder her father's debts?

45
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,581
Well, because we're family.

46
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,212
You have a family, too, don't you?

47
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,927
I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?

48
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,508
No...

49
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,977
Families sure can be a pain, huh?

50
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,527
What's the big idea?!

51
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,572
You don't have to draw your sword anymore.

52
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,025
Your presence alone will be sufficient.

53
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,656
Say what?! Why the hell
did you ask me here, then?

54
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,409
Wasn't it because you wanted to win your fights?

55
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:40,712
Listen. There are only two
kinds of people in the world.

56
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,791
The rulers and the ruled.

57
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:50,131
Just by having your strength under my control,
the ruled won't dare rise up against me.

58
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,262
That's what they call efficient ruling.

59
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:58,893
So, this power you keep talking about
is the power to control other people?

60
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,066
That's right. What's your point?

61
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,814
I ain't the least bit interested in that crap.

62
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,864
I don't wanna rule or be ruled, either one.

63
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,612
Where are you going?!

64
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,070
Stay with me, and you can do anything you want!

65
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,405
Are you seriously going to walk away from that?

66
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,210
For me, I don't believe in
anything but my own skills.

67
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,788
See you around.

68
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:27,047
Are you turning on me?! Do you
think you can just walk away?!

69
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,753
If you're gonna send somebody after me,

70
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,760
do me a favor and make sure they're damn tough!

71
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,976
What's with you? You want some?

72
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,731
I didn't believe in anything
but my own skills, either.

73
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:50,156
When I left Boss Kawara's gang,
I thought to myself,

74
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,326
I'm gonna use these skills of mine
to grab something better for myself.

75
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,404
That's all I need.

76
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,707
But the world doesn't work
that way. It's not that simple.

77
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:05,585
There are times when you gotta agree to
something even when you think it's wrong.

78
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,381
What a load of crap.

79
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,629
What?

80
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,961
Don't spend your life
making excuses to yourself.

81
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,264
You're the one who
decides how to live your life.

82
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,681
C'mon, act sexier, damn it!

83
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,563
My, what fine legs you have!

84
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,104
What's your problem?!

85
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,114
You better stop actin' all high and mighty!
You two are whores, got it?!

86
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,117
Come on, come closer
and attract some customers!

87
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,870
--Hey, you!
--Shut up!

88
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,794
If you're gonna hate somebody,
hate your old man.

89
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,169
--Don't!
--Ooh, I'm gettin' hot, I'm gettin' hot!

90
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,092
Y'know, maybe I'll buy you myself...

91
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,723
W-What the hell do you think you're doing?

92
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,480
B-Blood! It's blood!

93
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,058
I-It's a raid!

94
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,018
Sousuke?!

95
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,366
Sousuke!

96
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,072
Ishimatsu, you bastard!

97
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,123
You've got some nerve,
showing your face around here again!

98
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,918
You always think you can do whatever you want!

99
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,543
Ishimatsu...

100
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,249
I have news about your successor...

101
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,336
He stabbed one of our youngsters.

102
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,136
We were just doing business.

103
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,890
We never had any intention to
spill even a single drop of blood.

104
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,016
How do you intend to make amends for this?

105
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,399
An arm or two won't be nearly enough.

106
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,151
I'll take responsibility for this myself.

107
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,528
--Boss!
--We'll go with you!

108
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,699
Boss!

109
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,152
I'll be fine by myself.

110
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,987
Boss...

111
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,498
Sousuke, what have you done...?

112
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,295
I take full responsibility for his actions.

113
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,552
In that case, I have a proposal to make.

114
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,726
I want to resolve this
situation without bloodshed.

115
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,055
With that in mind, don't you think
we yakuza should behave like yakuza

116
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,357
and settle the matter through gambling?

117
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,106
If you win, I'll return your son to you.

118
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,155
In exchange, I'll take
control of your territory.

119
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,779
It's better than me taking his life, isn't it?

120
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,576
Very well.

121
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,871
And if I win, you will spare my son.

122
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,076
If I lose, I will have him atone
with his life for what he has done.

123
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,378
However...

124
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,001
What?

125
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,505
In the interest of fairness,
my gang will provide the dice roller.

126
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,961
Your gang will provide the dice.

127
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,387
Are you sure?

128
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,510
He knows what it means to be an outlaw.

129
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,685
He should be prepared to
pay the price at any time.

130
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,479
I look forward to our game, then.

131
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,488
What the heck are you two doing?

132
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,990
What about your promise not to kill each other?!

133
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,576
That little bitch!

134
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:34,085
What a dumb bastard. This will
let me take his territory legally.

135
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,255
What do you mean?

136
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,129
All I need to do is lose.

137
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,088
I'll deliberately lose, give his son
back to him, and take his territory.

138
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,470
But he said that they're going
to provide the dice roller...

139
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:49,681
Not to worry. Their dice roller
will never show up.

140
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,355
What are you saying, boss?!

141
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,434
We'll be at a disadvantage either way!

142
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,111
Either way, atonement must be made.

143
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,156
But if you lose, Sousuke's life will be--

144
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,450
--Boss!
--Boss!

145
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,621
A big wager?

146
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,325
Right. I overheard some
people talking a while ago.

147
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,254
They say the Nagatomis and Kawaras are
putting their gangs on the line in this match.

148
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,173
So, what will happen if the Kawara Gang wins?

149
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,720
What, do you think that we'll be set free
or something? Don't be so naive.

150
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,221
You mean there's going to be a gang war?

151
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,550
Of course there is!

152
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,854
Old man, this is for yesterday.

153
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,859
You don't want to catch cold, do you?

154
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,436
Thank you.

155
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,203
Where do you think you're going?

156
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,251
In yakuza fights over the years,
I've taken the lives

157
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:58,753
of countless people that I
harbored no ill will towards.

158
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:04,964
And the price I've paid is that I've
lost precious friends and family.

159
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,721
I've seen more than enough blood in my time.

160
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:16,104
It was because of them that I kept this gang
running in spite of that. For our youngsters.

161
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:23,362
In the end, we're outlaws. Humans who
can't get by in respectable society.

162
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:29,071
There will always be a handful
of such people in the world.

163
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:35,877
I thought to myself, someone
has to look after such people.

164
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:42,927
But when Ishimatsu left and and went to
the Nagatomis, something occurred to me.

165
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:48,928
I thought to myself, maybe it's
about time for me to step down.

166
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:54,058
I'll admit that with skills like yours,
you might be able to kill Rikiei.

167
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,187
But that would just cause
a new round of reprisals.

168
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,487
So leave this matter to me, all right?

169
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,985
Give this to Sousuke.

170
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,211
What are you doing?

171
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,385
Can't you tell?

172
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,759
Instead of catching the customers'
eyes, I'm scaring them away.

173
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,014
If we don't get any customers, we'll be fired,
and we'll be able to leave here, right?

174
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,014
Oh...

175
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,221
Don't give me that " Oh " stuff! You do it, too!

176
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,399
Great! What a terrific face!

177
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,022
You're the one for me!

178
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,731
I've always wanted to have a girl
scold me with that look on her face!

179
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,656
Y-You're kidding, right?

180
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,986
Yes, yes! That's the look!

181
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,913
You're great! You're my kind of girl!

182
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:01,996
Ow! That hurts!

183
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,082
Let go, you little-- Ow!

184
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,462
A vase...

185
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,295
Take this!

186
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,725
Sir, are you--

187
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,677
She ran away!

188
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,394
Excuse me! Where's the gambling house?

189
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,317
Hop in, hop in!

190
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:35,997
My name is O-Ryuu, and I will
act as your witness today.

191
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,702
It is an honor to serve you.

192
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,411
Where is your bodyguard?

193
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:45,249
He walked out on us. I doubt
that he's still in this town.

194
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,633
Both parties, please present your wagers.

195
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,180
"Signed Memorandum "

196
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:01,265
There will be one throw,
and I ask that there be no delays.

197
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:04,900
Where's the girl?

198
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,478
Um... She escaped.

199
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,111
Escaped?! That little moron!

200
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,658
I approve.

201
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,331
Now, Boss Kawara. Your dice roller?

202
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,580
It doesn't look like he's arrived yet.

203
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:25,129
He sure is late... I wonder what's keeping him?

204
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,295
He sure is late...

205
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,299
Damn it, I wonder what's keeping him?

206
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,351
So... Is this the gambling house?

207
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,723
--She's here!
--She's here!

208
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,020
Hurry, hurry!

209
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,223
This way, this way!

210
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,856
--We're counting on you!
--We're counting on you!

211
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,939
Come on, get changed! Get changed!

212
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,398
What in the--

213
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:57,078
If your roller isn't going to show up,
I suppose we'll have to provide one.

214
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,495
Wait a minute. Just a while longer.

215
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,793
Boss, the dice roller has arrived!

216
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,461
He what?!

217
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,172
What're you--

218
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,352
A little vase...

219
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,147
Let's play.

220
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,398
What will you do?

221
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,574
All I can do is place my fate
in the hands of the heavens.

222
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,321
Boss...

223
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,654
Very well, begin!

224
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:44,083
Are both parties ready? You are, then?

225
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,626
In they go!

226
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,340
Now, place your bets, place your bets!

227
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,007
Odd!

228
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,514
Even!

229
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,095
Play!

230
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,982
Two-five, odd!

231
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,654
We recognize the Nagatomi Gang
as the winner in this match.

232
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,740
I concede defeat.

233
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,695
As an outlaw, I will see to it that
this matter is seen through properly.

234
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,247
At any rate, I never wanted
to win in the first place.

235
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,244
Wha--?

236
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:28,078
I don't intend to make my dear
adopted children suffer under you.

237
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,881
What I'm saying is that I've no intention
to surrender my territory to you.

238
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,879
What are you playing at?

239
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,134
As we agreed, I will give
you a life in atonement.

240
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,969
I will atone with my own.

241
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,106
Dad! Dad!

242
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:06,200
This is pathetic. Talk about
an anachronistic farce...

243
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,001
Damn it, this won't make me one red cent.

244
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,998
You're wrong!

245
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,752
My father stayed true to his code as
an honorable outlaw right up to the end!

246
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:18,382
You aren't outlaws! You're nothing!
You're honorless thugs!

247
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:23,933
Being a thug suits me fine. I'll just
take your territory by force, that's all.

248
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,558
You fool. You threw your life away for nothing.

249
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,888
Careful, now!

250
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,726
Hold it right there, bodyguard.

251
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,738
What are you--

252
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,198
Why did you come here?

253
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,501
Nobody was comin' after me...

254
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,829
...so I figured I'd come after you guys instead!

255
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,959
Hold it! Don't you care what happens to--

256
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,417
Go ahead, see if I care!

257
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,184
Damn!

258
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:25,703
Ishimatsu, what are you doing?!
Get back there and kill those guys!

259
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:34,455
You never trusted me because
I used to be with the Kawaras.

260
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,211
It's not just me. You never
trusted the other guys, either.

261
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,510
The only thing you ever had faith in was money.

262
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,184
Ishimatsu...

263
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,887
I finally came to my senses.

264
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,235
This was my father's--

265
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,655
He said that he wanted me to give it to you.

266
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,998
Ishimatsu. Will you come back to us?

267
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,825
Sousuke...

268
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,457
I'm sure it's what my father would have done.

269
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,338
Thank you for offering. But I'm an outlaw, too.

270
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,672
I don't want to turn into the sort
of thug that you were talking about.

271
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:30,977
Once I've paid for what I've done,
I'll gladly take you up on your offer.

272
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,937
I want to settle things.

273
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,360
Thank you for all you've done.

274
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:47,410
I'm really happy for you, O-Suzu. Bye!

275
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,621
Bodyguard!

276
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,498
Come back someday, you hear?!

277
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,704
Sure.

278
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,915
Once we find the sunflower samurai, okay?

279
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:08,715
Sorry, pal, but I don't know
the meaning of the word restraint.

280
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,975
I don't doubt it.

281
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:50,761
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

282
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:56,013
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

283
00:21:56,106 --> 00:22:01,191
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

284
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,859
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

285
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:12,157
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

286
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,079
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

287
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:22,163
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

288
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:27,093
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

289
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:32,386
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

290
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:37,729
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

291
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:42,809
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

292
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:47,530
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

293
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:51,905
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

294
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,955
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

295
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:04,081
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

296
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:12,422
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
