1
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,469
It would've been too hard to say
goodbye, so I'm going by myself.

2
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:42,926
I really enjoyed the talk we had
around the campfire last night.

3
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,185
I thought to myself, "I wish
that this could go on forever. "

4
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,517
But then I got scared all of a sudden.

5
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,651
If something happened and we
were split up, what would happen?

6
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:59,108
Maybe I'd been relying on
you guys too much all this time.

7
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,992
Would I be able to make it on my own
once this journey ended and I was on my own?

8
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,573
I gave that a lot of thought.

9
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,545
And that's why I'm going by myself.

10
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,750
On the cape to the north, there's
a house standing there by itself.

11
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,960
Go there.

12
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,007
You should hurry. He doesn't have much longer.

13
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,644
Thank you so much!

14
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,221
Thank you!

15
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,439
And now, although it pains me to say it,
I will have to insist that you two die here.

16
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:39,944
Are you here by yourself?
You got a big pair on ya.

17
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:44,028
Come. Don't disappoint me.

18
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,706
I want him to understand how we feel.

19
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,875
W-What are you talking about?

20
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,579
I'm saying that this place will be your grave.

21
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,208
" Evanescent Encounter (Part 2)
(The Cycle of Death and Rebirth, Part 2) "

22
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,301
This oughta be fun...

23
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,516
Now I see.

24
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:01,651
You utilize movements that confound
any attempt to predict them.

25
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:06,486
But in the martial arts, you must
make better use of your intellect.

26
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,196
When you rely solely upon instinct and reflex,

27
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,407
you involuntarily make your limitations known.

28
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,459
Quit talkin' like you're hot shit!

29
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:41,316
And now, would you care to
show me your Muju Shin Kenjutsu?

30
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,115
Show me the skill that
struck down Enshiro Mariya.

31
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,074
How did you know about that?

32
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,582
Of course. You're with the Shogunate.

33
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,507
Shit!

34
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,268
Get back here!

35
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,879
Crap...

36
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,379
Who the hell are you?

37
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,759
Mugen...!

38
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,342
We have the girl.

39
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,726
Come to the church on the island. Got it?

40
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,025
Say what? Look, we're kinda busy here!

41
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:48,526
If you don't hurry, we won't be
responsible for what happens.

42
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:53,532
You should go there before
she ends up in little pieces!

43
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,739
Don't piss me off!

44
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,369
Go!

45
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,123
I'll take care of things here.

46
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,623
Screw that, you go!

47
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,213
You know, I don't really want
to think about stuff like that.

48
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,266
If you did, that jerk Mugen would...

49
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,930
Sorry... I'm sorry.

50
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,063
Look after Fuu.

51
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,986
What's the matter?
Which of you is going to fight me?

52
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,749
Don't get yourself killed!

53
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,296
You and I have unfinished business, you hear?!

54
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,838
--Get moving!
--Y-Yes, sir!

55
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:36,346
It seems that we can finally fight
without any distractions now.

56
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,516
How did you know I use the Muju style?

57
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,139
Fate is a fascinating thing.

58
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:51,108
If you hadn't killed Mariya, the Muju style
would have been mine by now.

59
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,655
As I thought. You're Kagetoki Kariya.

60
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:03,240
You're going to turn Muju Shin
Kenjutsu into a band of assassins?

61
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,950
Are you telling me to walk the path of darkness?

62
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,963
No, I am telling you that there is no other way.

63
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:18,760
Serving Master Kariya is the same
as serving the Shogunate itself.

64
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,935
You're splitting hairs.
It would no longer be a martial art.

65
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,553
" Nothing but Swords in One's Mind "

66
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,859
This is no longer the Warring States period.

67
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:37,817
This land at peace has no need of
kenjutsu styles meant to kill people.

68
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:42,280
All martial arts schools are in decline.

69
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,365
I ask that you endure this, Jin.

70
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,663
I can't believe it. You were--

71
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,669
Indeed I was.

72
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,511
You're ordering me to kill my pupil?

73
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:03,888
I intend to pass on the dojo to him. I can't...

74
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:14,270
As you may have guessed,
it was I who put him up to it.

75
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,545
I see your skills have grown, Jin.

76
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,008
Master...!

77
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:55,106
In any event, your destiny is to die at my hand.

78
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,356
Very well.

79
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,736
And I expect to see this
so-called Hand of the Gods at work.

80
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:06,288
Gladly. I've been sitting idle for far too long.

81
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,846
I can't do it... I can't.

82
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,515
Hey, you're that guy from--

83
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:33,520
I was ordered not to touch you
until you got to the church...

84
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:40,527
...but the guy that I wanna kill so bad
I can taste it is right under my nose.

85
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,201
I can't hold it in!

86
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,324
I can't... I can't do it...

87
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,966
Why?

88
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:10,765
Why would a man as skilled as you are
stoop to being the Shogunate's dog?

89
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:17,818
In this day and age, do you think that
a man can live by his sword skills alone?

90
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:22,819
In that case, are you saying that you have
a lord that is worth risking your life for?

91
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:30,031
There is nothing but lords who prize empty
honor and think only of self-preservation.

92
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,706
There are none who are
worth laying down my life--

93
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,830
You're exactly right.

94
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,004
I'm not their puppet.

95
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:43,756
I'm pretending to be used by them,
when in reality I am using them, that's all.

96
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:48,180
The age of the samurai will
probably come to an end soon.

97
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:55,515
I hate to say it, but it looks like
I was born into the wrong era.

98
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,645
I was, as were you.

99
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:15,080
What's the matter? Is that Ryukyu sword style
of yours useless in tight spaces like this?!

100
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,202
You're a man of considerable skill.

101
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,372
I haven't enjoyed myself
this much in quite some time.

102
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,792
This match will probably be
settled by a razor-thin margin.

103
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:03,252
It is by a razor-thin margin that you will lose.

104
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:37,245
His speed is astonishing. And I don't
see a single opening in his defense.

105
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,455
One move... There is only
one move that will end this.

106
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,716
A samurai who smells of sunflowers?

107
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,053
Sunflowers have no smell.

108
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:46,109
So wouldn't that mean that there's
no samurai who smells of sunflowers?

109
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,153
You're wrong! That can't be true!

110
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,250
Hang in there for a little while longer.

111
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:07,125
I'll put you out of your misery soon enough.

112
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,800
You people are just wasting
your time by doing this.

113
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,971
Mugen always hacks away without
giving the hostage a second thought.

114
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,299
Oh, he does, does he?

115
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,389
Then I suppose that means that it won't
make any difference if I kill the hostage.

116
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:47,876
Well, even if I don't kill you, there's always
the option of leaving you half dead.

117
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,468
After all, all that matters
is that you're alive.

118
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,940
Mugen!

119
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,359
You're gonna give her back.

120
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:22,743
So, we meet at last. That makes me so happy.

121
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,199
Who the hell are you people?

122
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,661
Don't play dumb with me.

123
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:36,174
Even if you've forgotten, the three of us
will never forget until the day we die.

124
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:45,138
Listen. We three brothers were fairly
well-known down in the domain of Satsuma.

125
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,096
And then...

126
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:54,855
We were in charge of that raw sugar ship.

127
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,986
The ship that you and Mukuro boarded.

128
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,378
Thanks to you, our older
brother ended up like this.

129
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:15,128
We were suspected of being responsible
for the raid and were driven out of Satsuma.

130
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,336
Our chances for government
service went up in smoke, too.

131
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:25,473
Our only reason for living now
is to track you down and kill you.

132
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:29,147
Look, about your other brother...

133
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,020
I sent him to the bottom of
the sea a few minutes ago.

134
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,692
Y-You bastard!

135
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:43,449
Don't you understand? We don't give
a rat's ass about this girl's life.

136
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,325
Hold it.

137
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:53,914
I'll put down my sword.
In return, let the girl go.

138
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,964
What did you say?

139
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,051
You can't...

140
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:15,527
Get going. You haven't met
the Sunflower Samurai yet, right?

141
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,605
I can't do that... I can't leave you.

142
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:24,865
Cut the crap. What do you think
we came all this way for?

143
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,822
Get your ass moving!

144
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,250
But... They're going to...

145
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,580
I ain't gonna die. Have some faith in me.

146
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,167
--Mugen...
--Beat it.

147
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,047
Get going.

148
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,922
Run, bitch!

149
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:53,523
Aw. you're gonna make me cry.
You're throwing your life away for a woman?

150
00:19:55,361 --> 00:20:00,572
Have it your way, then.
I'll kill you nice and slowly.

151
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,537
Oops! Maybe I cut too deeply.

152
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:23,260
Come on, let me have some more fun with you!

153
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,053
Bastard...

154
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,413
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

155
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:44,501
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

156
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:52,726
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

157
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:57,306
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

158
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:02,356
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

159
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:07,608
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

160
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:12,786
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

161
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:17,454
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

162
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:23,707
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

163
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:28,633
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

164
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:33,762
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

165
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:38,688
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

166
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:43,981
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

167
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:49,324
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

168
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,404
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

169
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,125
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

170
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:03,454
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

171
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,508
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

172
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:15,680
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

173
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:20,809
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
