1
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,433
" Gamblers and Gallantry (Fallen Angel)"

2
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,981
I wonder if those two are out
working like they're supposed to...

3
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,274
Fuu! Deliver this order, okay?

4
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,897
Coming!

5
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,452
Perhaps this is none of my business...

6
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,784
This canal isn't as deep as it appears.

7
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,121
If you intend to throw yourself in and drown
yourself, it would be wiser to choose another.

8
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,500
Did it look to you like I was
going to throw myself in?

9
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,052
I was looking at the canal, that's all.

10
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,590
What? You don't believe me?

11
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,848
My goodness... Did I have such
a dejected look on my face?

12
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,726
Honestly, I would never
do something that painful.

13
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,482
Thank you for the warning. Bye.

14
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,119
C'mon! C'mon! Shove him! Shove him!

15
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,162
Do you wanna win this thing or don't ya?!

16
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,087
Don't touch me!

17
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,798
--You little punk!
--Screw you!

18
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,721
Excuse me.

19
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,269
Oh, there you are! You're my part-timer, right?

20
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,892
Boy, are you a lifesaver!

21
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,064
Okay, mind the stall while I'm gone!

22
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,608
I was led to believe that
this job involved blade work.

23
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,607
Oh, there's cutting, all right.

24
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,282
Relax, in this rain, you won't
be getting many customers.

25
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,574
Wait! Hey!

26
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,617
Okay, it's all yours, buddy!

27
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,533
One grilled eel, please.

28
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,744
Oh, you're that samurai from earlier.

29
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:40,546
" Eel "

30
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,762
Oh, that's the one! I want
that spirited one there.

31
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,355
Listen, you'll never catch
an eel using brute force.

32
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,941
You anticipate the eel's movement...

33
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,243
Now!

34
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:14,623
Eels are like women. If you try to use force
to hold them down, they'll only run away.

35
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,092
You fix it in place like this, and then...

36
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,510
Allow me to slice it.

37
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,087
Wait just a minute!

38
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,922
Eels are Hamamatsu's pride and joy!

39
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,054
It's bad luck to hack away at one
with a huge thing like that!

40
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,482
--What'll it be, ma'am?
--Three grilled eels, please.

41
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,608
Coming right up!

42
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,315
Here, start putting the pieces on skewers.

43
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,321
Five grilled eels, and I'm in a big hurry.

44
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,492
Coming right up!

45
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,411
Two for me.

46
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,536
Get the sauce ready! Hurry! Hurry!

47
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,123
Step right up! Come one, come all!

48
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,580
Doubles your energy! Makes your family healthy!

49
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,290
Get your grilled eel,
the specialty of Hamamatsu!

50
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,252
How about some eel tonight?!

51
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,515
Boy, business was booming...
Not a bad night's work, I'd say.

52
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:15,221
Hey, wait a minute. I didn't come here to work.

53
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,021
Allow me to cook one for you.

54
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,919
When you cook something, you make
sure it's good and cooked, don't you?

55
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,714
I'll eat it, anyway.
You went to all that trouble.

56
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,416
Well, here goes.

57
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,214
Yuck. This is impressive.

58
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,391
I've never eaten eel that
tastes this bad before.

59
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,345
Maybe that also takes talent,
in a manner of speaking.

60
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,474
Have some water.

61
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,227
I'd rather have tea.

62
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,691
I'm done.

63
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,567
Thank you. This has given me
some wonderful memories.

64
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,569
Bye.

65
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,275
Memories?

66
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:16,449
I'm starting work in a brothel tomorrow.

67
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:21,082
So today is the last day that I'll
be able to wander around freely.

68
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,505
My husband fell into debt,
and I'm the collateral.

69
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,255
I suppose this sort of thing
happens all the time.

70
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,631
Well, I should go. Bye-bye.

71
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,024
C'mon, let's see some more
spirit when you pull that thing.

72
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,820
I'm back!

73
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,735
I know I'm not gonna like the answer,
but what are you doing here?

74
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,117
I'm training. Can't you tell?

75
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,414
Beetle sumo wrestling.

76
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,163
I'm gonna train this guy up proper
and enter him in matches.

77
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,961
Weren't you going to work as a bodyguard?

78
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,004
Oh, I quit that.

79
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,207
What do you mean, you quit?!
What about our money?!

80
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:11,966
Oh, quit your nagging. I'm gonna
make a bundle with this bad boy.

81
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,548
You jerk! Get yourself a legit job!

82
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,395
Excuse me.

83
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,734
You came all the way here just to return this?

84
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,107
That's right.

85
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,784
Thank you. But I won't
need that anymore, either.

86
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,237
I'm not allowed to go out in the outside world.

87
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:42,326
It could rain or pour outside,
and it wouldn't matter to me.

88
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,628
If you like, go ahead and use this for yourself.

89
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,299
Look at you, you're soaked to the bone.

90
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,589
Kohana. You have a customer.

91
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,347
All right, I'll be right there.

92
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,934
One more thing...

93
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,310
Your name. I never asked what it was.

94
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,316
My name is Shino.

95
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,570
But I don't need that name anymore, either.

96
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,571
What's yours?

97
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,448
It's Jin.

98
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,532
Thank you, Jin. Goodbye.

99
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,958
Yeah, baby! If you don't win, you don't eat!

100
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,920
Why the heck do I have to come here
and watch a couple of bugs duke it out?

101
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,260
Just because he made it drag that rock
around for a day doesn't mean it's gonna--

102
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,345
Get in there, Rodriguez!

103
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,396
Get your ass in there!

104
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,563
--Yeah!
--No way!

105
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,443
It actually won!

106
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,584
Did I forget something else at the stall?

107
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,880
No.

108
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,003
You came here for a good time, then?

109
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:21,221
I'm sorry. I appreciate it, but you're
interfering with business, so please leave.

110
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:25,475
I don't have time to chat with you.

111
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,806
Please, don't come here again.

112
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,396
Welcome, sir! Have you spotted
a girl who strikes your fancy?

113
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,608
--Act now, and...
--I have no money.

114
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,567
We have a window-shopper, boys!

115
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:44,452
We don't run this business to give broke
samurai some free eye candy, got it?

116
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,534
If you need some action,
come back with some money!

117
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,332
--What's your problem?
--You're bad for business!

118
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,882
Don't show your face around here again!

119
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,758
Well? Whaddya have to say now, huh?

120
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:48,437
After paying off what we owe for staying here...

121
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,104
...we still have plenty left!

122
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,772
This needs to go into savings!

123
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,851
Don't be so tightfisted!

124
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,108
I'm gonna use this as seed money
to make another pile of money!

125
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,486
Jin!

126
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,159
What happened to you? How'd you get hurt?

127
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,611
It's nothing.

128
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,664
How can you say that? Look at you!

129
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,786
That money--

130
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,209
When did you--

131
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:15,039
Hey, it's my money. I won it fair
and square in beetle sumo wrestling.

132
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,215
--Let me borrow it.
--Say what?

133
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,338
What do you want it for?

134
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,385
I need to buy a woman.

135
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,602
You! I thought I told you not to come here!

136
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,649
Back again for another
lesson, huh? Weren't we clear?

137
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,695
You that eager to get your ass kicked again?

138
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,694
Welcome, kind sir! Is Kohana
the girl you've selected, sir?

139
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,367
Um, allow me to take your swords.

140
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,286
House rules, sir.

141
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,740
Take your time, sir.

142
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:56,000
What do you think he meant by that?
What did Jin mean, buying a woman?

143
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,297
I'm glad to hear it, aren't you?

144
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,669
Hear what?

145
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,629
That bozo's never shown any interest in girls,
so I was gettin' a little suspicious.

146
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,929
About what?

147
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,598
--That maybe he's a homo.
--No way!

148
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,677
Well, this is good news.
That's a load of my mind.

149
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:15,687
How can you say that?! Anyway, what does
he need with another woman when I'm around?

150
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,484
Oh, so you're saying that you wanna be his girl?

151
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,902
I-I didn't say that...

152
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,822
Big talk, coming from a
girl who's flat as a board.

153
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,491
I'm the type of girl who looks
more slender in clothing.

154
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,193
--You big liar.
--I am not!

155
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,698
Then let's see what you got.

156
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,998
Fine, I'll give you an eyeful!

157
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,245
No, I shouldn't...

158
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,078
Oh, you're jealous, huh?

159
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,708
Of course I'm not jealous!

160
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,962
What in the world would give
you the idea that I'm jealous?!

161
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,885
Lone wolf wannabes like him
that always have blank expressions

162
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,258
and you can never tell what they're thinking

163
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,635
are so not my type!

164
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,514
You fell asleep?!

165
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,223
Would you like some sake?

166
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,603
No.

167
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,731
I see.

168
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,281
That's all right. Let's just sit like this.

169
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,534
If you like, but you're paying so
much money for time with me...

170
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,753
It doesn't look like this rain will
stop anytime soon, eel man.

171
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,630
I don't run an eel stand.

172
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,713
I'm on a journey, and I was only
working there to earn money for lodgings.

173
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,093
Oh, so you're a traveler.

174
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,551
But I've been held up in this city
for a while now because of the rain.

175
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:38,231
Oh, I see. Once the rain stops, you'll leave.

176
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:43,562
I hope that the rain will never stop.

177
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,649
Then, I would be able to stay here forever.

178
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,697
I didn't mean that as a joke.

179
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,579
I'm sorry... Nobody talks
like that in this day and age.

180
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:04,333
Miss Shino... Don't you hate this job?

181
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,794
Sure, there are things about it that I hate.

182
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:13,350
But the thing is, I laugh when I'm actually sad.

183
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,098
I'm frustrated, so I laugh it off.

184
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,903
I swear, my business is
terrible because of this rain.

185
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,482
The only customer I've had today
is some samurai who wears glasses.

186
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,866
He's got a thing for Kohana, my new girl.

187
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:38,290
She was sold to me to cover her husband's debts.

188
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,869
A wife can't file for divorce
against her husband,

189
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:45,081
so I guess it was her bad luck
to be stuck with a lousy husband.

190
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,850
Let's leave this place.

191
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,428
What are you saying?

192
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,731
I can't let you do this anymore...

193
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,854
Don't make it sound so simple.

194
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,529
Do you have any idea how much it
costs to buy a prostitute's freedom?

195
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:12,109
Even if there were a hundred of you,
you still wouldn't be able to earn enough.

196
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:17,038
Back when I got married, even my parents
were happy that I was marrying into money.

197
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,869
But my husband had a gambling problem,
and he amassed a mountain of debt.

198
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:26,457
The next thing I knew, the young wife of the
textiles merchant had become the town whore.

199
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,713
Please, just let it go.

200
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:38,928
I appreciate the sentiment, really.
But talk like that is just a pipe dream.

201
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,473
Begging your pardon, sir.
Kohana, you have a visitor.

202
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,524
I'll be right there.

203
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,980
Fairy tale time is over. Please, go home.

204
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,115
C'mon, Shino, I'm begging you. Spot me a little.

205
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,321
You don't expect me to have any money, do you?

206
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,407
Aw, don't be like that, baby...

207
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,244
Customers slip you a little
under the table, right?

208
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,547
Why don't you give up gambling
and earn an honest living?

209
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,215
What did you say?!

210
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,094
What, you got a problem with my gambling?

211
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,846
You wanna leave me?

212
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,053
Sorry, baby, but I don't feel
like letting you go just yet.

213
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,651
What do you think you're doing, you bastard?!

214
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,729
I'm her husband!

215
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,735
I can do whatever I want to her!

216
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,534
That's enough! Let him go!

217
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,202
Shit! I'm gonna bleed you dry for
as long as you live, you hear me?!

218
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,957
Remember that!

219
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,599
Where are you going?

220
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,682
Back to see that Kohana lady?

221
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:12,521
Why? It's not like I don't understand
why you'd feel sorry for her, but--

222
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,355
It isn't out of pity.

223
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:19,820
You aren't seriously telling me
that you're in love with her, are you?

224
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:23,702
Jin, you aren't gonna run
away with her, are you?

225
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,706
If I don't come back...

226
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,254
...I want the two of you to continue
your journey without me.

227
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,922
You can't be serious...

228
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,343
You promised me that you'd help me look
for the sunflower samurai, didn't you?

229
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,593
If you leave, we're through
as friends, you hear?!

230
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:44,303
You promised me!
We've traveled together all this time!

231
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,683
Forgive me.

232
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,435
You jerk!

233
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,069
Welcome.

234
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,612
What's the matter?

235
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,486
We're leaving.

236
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,817
Pack what you need.

237
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,573
I can't leave... It's hopeless.

238
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:06,283
Even if I manage to get away from here,
they'll follow me to the ends of the earth.

239
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,665
There is a divorce temple across the river.

240
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,168
If you ask for shelter there,
they might help you.

241
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,874
I can't do that.

242
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,587
Even if they give me sanctuary,
I'll just be a prisoner again.

243
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,093
I won't be able to leave for three years.

244
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,596
I won't be able to meet you like this, either.

245
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,554
I would rather wait for you here.

246
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,267
That day when I met you on the bridge...

247
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,852
You really were planning
to kill yourself, weren't you?

248
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,448
I was.

249
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:44,780
If you hadn't happened by
when you did, right now I'd be...

250
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,619
Let's go. Together.

251
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:55,707
I'm sorry to interrupt your good time,
sir, but your time is up, so you need to--

252
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,881
You're amazing...!

253
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,335
Give me an extension.

254
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,261
Take your time, sir!

255
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,552
I'll go down first and wait for you.

256
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,884
But...

257
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,593
It'll be all right.

258
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,395
Now, sir, about that extension fee...

259
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,400
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!

260
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,194
Come back here, you bitch!

261
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,862
Hurry!

262
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,570
We've got a runner! Catch her!

263
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,576
Come back here!

264
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,970
Listen, you two. In this world,
you don't always get what you want.

265
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,855
I thought you said you two were quits!

266
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,857
Forget what I said, just hurry!

267
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,987
You're pathetic, man.

268
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,538
Jin!

269
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,491
I want my money back!

270
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,292
Hurry!

271
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,803
Shino!

272
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:30,510
You aren't trying to run away
from me, are you, baby?

273
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,687
I've had enough of living
my life under your thumb.

274
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,856
I'm taking my life back.

275
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,028
That's the price of the woman
who used to be your wife.

276
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,239
There she is! Catch her!

277
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,204
Jin!

278
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,215
Thank you.

279
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,203
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

280
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,291
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

281
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:51,516
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

282
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:56,096
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

283
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:01,147
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

284
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:06,398
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

285
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:11,577
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

286
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:16,244
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

287
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:22,498
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

288
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:27,423
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

289
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:32,553
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

290
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:37,478
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

291
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:42,771
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

292
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:48,114
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

293
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,194
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

294
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,915
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

295
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:02,245
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

296
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,298
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

297
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:14,471
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

298
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,850
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
