1
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,429
Bastard...

2
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,928
Do you work for Matsumae domain?

3
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:46,262
Where the hell is that?
And who the hell are you?!

4
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,018
Say that you killed me if you like.

5
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,311
I might as well be dead already.

6
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,831
I'm looking for a samurai
who smells of sunflowers.

7
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,704
Um... Would it be okay
if I went with you, Okuru?

8
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,540
We're police officers with the
Matsumae domain magistrate's office.

9
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,173
Come along peacefully, Okuru!

10
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,844
Give yourself up!

11
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,859
I guess you guys ain't
your usual street punks...

12
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:45,279
Look, fellas, you're makin' a big mistake here.

13
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,581
What makes you think I'm
the guy you're lookin' for?

14
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,081
We're after a man by the name of Okuru.

15
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,913
He's a criminal who has fled
all the way from Matsumae.

16
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,125
We were told that he's wearing strange
clothes and is hiding in these mountains.

17
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,553
--I'm looking for that guy, too!
--What?

18
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,009
So, what did this Okuru guy do, anyway?

19
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,186
This man isn't Okuru. Pull out! Pull out!

20
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,433
Hey! Come back here, damn it!

21
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,402
You mistake me for somebody else, and you're
gonna take off without even apologizing?

22
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:22,570
" Lullabies of the Lost, Verse 2
(Idling Your Life Away, Verse 2)"

23
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:30,491
You cannot come with me.

24
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,331
Why not?

25
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,914
I've killed domain soldiers and am on the run.

26
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,670
If you went with me, you would
become a fugitive as well.

27
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:46,098
The guys that I've been with up until
now have done a lot worse than that.

28
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,802
If you have friends, you should go with them.

29
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,644
Those coldhearted jerks
are no friends of mine...

30
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:59,775
Once you have traveled with someone,
they become like family. Like brothers.

31
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,902
You are not all alone in this world.

32
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,485
Okuru, are you always going to travel alone?

33
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,074
My wife and daughter are always with me.

34
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,701
Now, go to sleep.

35
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,958
He was probably driven mad by the disease.

36
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,088
I heard that he killed everyone in his village,

37
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,764
and then even killed the domain
soldiers who went in to capture him.

38
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,262
The man even killed his wife and daughter.

39
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,094
If we leave him running loose,
there's no telling what he might do!

40
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,100
Driven insane, huh?

41
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,274
Funny, he didn't look crazy to me.

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,691
I'll take him down.

43
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,315
What?

44
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,450
You better warn your buddies.
Tell 'em to stay outta my way!

45
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,630
I have no more seeds for you.

46
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,549
--Oh, you made it, huh?
--Yes, sir.

47
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,126
What about that man at the river?

48
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,712
As we thought, he doesn't appear to be Okuru.

49
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,846
He is too young, and he said that
he was from the Ryukyu Islands.

50
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,972
Anyone who interferes is to
be considered an accomplice.

51
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,770
--The next time you see him,
feel free to kill him.
--Yes, sir!

52
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:02,898
I swear, these mountains
are crawling with crazy people.

53
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,024
Lord Tamoto!

54
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,857
We found the remains of a fire
downstream on the riverbank.

55
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,657
As well as shavings left
from arrows being carved.

56
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,951
Okuru is an archer.

57
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,701
No doubt about it. He's here in this forest.

58
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,659
Reinforcements will be arriving
from Matsumae soon, too.

59
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,041
We can't pass up this opportunity.
We're going to take Okuru's head!

60
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,329
You want those guys to find you or something?

61
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:32,217
That music sounds a lot like
something I heard when I was a kid.

62
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,716
Where are you from?

63
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,924
The Ryukyus. Islands way to the south.

64
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,975
I'm from the far north.

65
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,723
Funny thing, isn't it?

66
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:48,650
We're from places that are nowhere near
each other, but I've heard similar music.

67
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,945
So, you must be Okuru.

68
00:08:55,452 --> 00:09:00,287
They were right on your tail. Those guys
from Matsumae domain or whatever.

69
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:05,037
You made a whole heap of trouble
for me. They thought I was you.

70
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,494
And did they buy you off?

71
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:13,004
All I want is to go one-on-one with you.

72
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:17,588
They said you lost your mind
because of some disease.

73
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,220
But you don't look that way to me.

74
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:25,179
They say you're a guy who
even killed his own wife and kid.

75
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,363
Momo?

76
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,620
Okuru?

77
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,519
--Hey!
--Jin?!

78
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,641
What happened?

79
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,941
Just now, I saw something up there.
I don't know what it was...

80
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,893
It was carrying a sword!

81
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:19,400
Or more to the point,
what the heck are you doing here?

82
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,155
Why are you here?

83
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,534
That's none of your business.

84
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,333
Something tells me you didn't finally
feel sorry and come back to me.

85
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,911
I thought that you might have drowned.

86
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,622
This was floating in the river.

87
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,675
And you were gonna keep it as
a memento of me or something?

88
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,253
I thought I might place it on
your corpse as an offering.

89
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,802
Well, thanks anyway.

90
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,933
What happened to your arm?
Don't tell me that jerk actually cut you!

91
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,232
It's just a scratch. I got it
when I jumped over a waterfall.

92
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,483
Jumped over a waterfall...?
I'm amazed you survived.

93
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,736
--What about Mugen?
--What about Mugen?

94
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,737
I haven't seen him.

95
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
I see.

96
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,075
Oh, I know! Wait here a second.
I'll go get some medicinal herbs.

97
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,081
I'm pretty sure they were over here...

98
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,799
It was people from the domain who
brought the disease to my village.

99
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:30,729
While I was away, the village
became a mountain of corpses.

100
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,148
It was a terrible sight.

101
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:38,524
That is how my village was destroyed.

102
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,357
It makes no difference to me
whether or not you believe me.

103
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,114
I've seen eyes like yours before.

104
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,571
They look like something.

105
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,328
Like the half-open eyes of a
head that's been chopped off.

106
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,287
They're still a little bit moist,
and you can't tell where they're lookin'.

107
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,794
Are you really alive?

108
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,429
Jin! What's going on? What're you doing?

109
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,806
Did you think you could fool me?

110
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:18,060
Do you know why these mountains
are revered by so many people?

111
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,236
Because they say you will be reborn here.

112
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:24,282
Death and rebirth... Everyone
comes here in search of them.

113
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,860
These seem to be one of those mountains.

114
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,573
Are you looking to be reborn, too?

115
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,532
Yukimaru...

116
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:38,042
You won't truly be dead until
I kill you with my own two hands!

117
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,753
You are still young.

118
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,756
I am an old man of nearly forty.

119
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,384
I have lived past my time.

120
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,093
Perhaps it is time to put
an end to my endless flight.

121
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,731
You're pretty spry for an old man!

122
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,524
Why do you keep running from me?!

123
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,713
You are determined to go through with this?

124
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:29,013
Even if you betray me,
even if you turn your back on me,

125
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,343
I will never let you get away from me!

126
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,443
What's the matter? Outta arrows already?

127
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:45,757
When I said I only wanted to make
a name for myself, that was a lie...

128
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:50,507
I only wanted... one thing.

129
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,429
To be you.

130
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,133
Yukimaru...

131
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,826
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

132
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,788
Who was he, Jin? Did you know him?

133
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,210
He was like a little brother to me.

134
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,586
That's ancient history now.

135
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,005
We found him! It's Okuru!

136
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,554
Meet up with the others! Hurry!

137
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,976
Okuru...? Did they say Okuru just now?

138
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,270
Yes.

139
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,938
Hey, come back!

140
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,559
Can you hear me? There's nowhere you can run!

141
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,646
Surrendering and coming out
is in your own best interest!

142
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,777
You bastards, stay out of this!

143
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,578
Geez, these guys are getting on my nerves...

144
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,531
Do you know this Okuru man?

145
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,537
I have to help him! I owe him my life!

146
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,459
You have a strong sense of duty, I see.

147
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,459
When duty goes out of style,
the world will be nothing but darkness!

148
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,629
You should go. I am tired of running.

149
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,089
Hey!

150
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,802
And I must settle matters with those people.

151
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,853
Perhaps what you said is true.

152
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,936
That day in my village,
perhaps I became one of the dead.

153
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,736
--Get going.
--Hey, wait a minute!

154
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,950
Oh, geez...! Which way?!

155
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,668
Momo? Where's Okuru?!

156
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,340
This way?

157
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,217
Okuru. We meet at last.

158
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:01,677
Now I can finally bring your
head back home with me.

159
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,389
You people don't know what really happened.

160
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:26,001
That official didn't make the
slightest effort to save anyone.

161
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,545
He was just afraid that the
disease would spread further,

162
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,839
so he simply burned the village to the ground.

163
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,813
Even if that's true,
I'm still going to bring you in.

164
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,266
Those are my orders.

165
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,147
Okuru?

166
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,568
You bastards!

167
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,496
Keep your hands off him! He's mine!

168
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,957
What're you--

169
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,216
Y-You... You monster!

170
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,988
I never met anybody like him before.

171
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,836
I know he's still alive.

172
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,166
Something in my gut says he is.

173
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,847
"Ghost of Yoshitsune, " my butt...

174
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,728
That rumor must've been a mix
of stories about those two.

175
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,652
I swear, what a load of garbage...

176
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,732
So tell me.

177
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,490
Why are you trying to find
this sunflower samurai guy?

178
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,162
Is it revenge?

179
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,665
That's right.

180
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,870
Revenge for my mom. Or something like that.

181
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,549
At any rate, wars aren't won
on an empty stomach.

182
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,172
Damn straight!

183
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,804
Hey, where are you going?!

184
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:48,555
Where the hell is this Nagasaki place, anyway?
They got any good food there?

185
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:52,855
I'm told they have a sponge cake there called
a castella that was brought over from Europe.

186
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,234
C'mon, let's get moving!
