1
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:42,597
Long ago, the stars glittering in the night sky
acted as a vital set of guideposts to travelers.

2
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:48,602
These heavenly bodies were thought to be
everlasting, that they would shine forever.

3
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:54,688
It is for this reason that when meteors
or comets suddenly fell from the skies,

4
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,694
they were feared as sinister omens.

5
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:06,874
It was believed that something terrible would
befall anyone who saw these shining objects.

6
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,951
And no wonder.

7
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:13,255
Even after a scholar named
Shunkai Shibukawa was appointed

8
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:17,176
as the Shogunate 's first official
astronomer at the start of the Edo era,

9
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:22,006
most people were still unaware
that the Earth was round.

" Cosmic Collisions (Rage Against the Heavens) "

A shooting star!

12
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,622
I wish that we find the samurai
who smells of sunflowers soon.

13
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,620
I wish that we make it to Nagasaki safely.

14
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,498
And I wanna eat until I'm stuffed!

15
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,755
Isn't that a--

16
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,588
Hey, isn't that a matsutake mushroom?

17
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,173
What, you don't know what those are?

18
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,977
They call them the jewels of the mountains.
They're worth a lot of money.

19
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,771
Hey! C'mon, spit it out!

20
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:18,229
Mushrooms are spread by spores.
In other words, if you see one, there are...

21
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,032
--Don't eat that!
--Found another!

22
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,451
Over here, too.

23
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,278
Darn it!

24
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,082
Geez, I'm stuffed...

25
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,790
--I have heartburn...
--Gone... Gone... Gone! Gone!

26
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,545
They're all gone...

27
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,797
They ate every last one...

28
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,753
Oh, that reminds me.

29
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:49,185
The horoscope section in the newspaper
said to beware of mushrooms.

30
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,138
--Hey.
--Bitch, you should've told
us that before we ate 'em!

31
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,797
Ow...

32
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,092
Is everyone all right?

33
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,794
Where are we?

34
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,850
Jin?

35
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,222
Mugen?

36
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,771
Your hands are freezing. What's wrong with you?

37
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,849
They're as cold as a corpse's.

38
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,850
This is amazing... What is this place?

39
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,850
They seem to be excavating something.

40
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,782
Hey!

41
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,076
D-Don't scare us like that!

42
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,199
We thought you were ghosts or something.

43
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,826
Sorry about that.

44
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,126
Try to be more careful!

45
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:49,840
? Men piled onto horses, and horses
piled onto men, one atop the other. ?

46
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:55,428
? In spite of the great depth of the valley, ?

47
00:05:55,522 --> 00:06:02,439
? the 70,000 soldiers of the Heike were
enough to fill the valley to the brim. ?

48
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,396
? The corpses created a mountain of the dead, ?

49
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,823
? and blood flowed from
the stones like a river! ?

"Tale of the Heike, volume 7.
The Descent into Kurikara. "

51
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,247
The end!

52
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,660
Well, well, what have we here?

53
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,714
To think that wayward travelers
would find their way to this place.

54
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,213
Um... What is it that you're doing here?

55
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:34,676
My good visitor, were you aware that these
two holes symbolize the sun and the moon?

56
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,682
And were you aware that the music
that issues forth from the biwa

57
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,606
is the sound of the stars themselves?

58
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,184
Strum the strings of this biwa!

59
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,070
Do so, and one can even call down
the stars from the night sky!

60
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,573
Who the hell are you?

61
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,949
Yes, yes, how rude of me.

62
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,499
Even so, one must remember
that we were here first.

63
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,545
It seems unreasonable for
visitors who have wandered in

64
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:07,875
to demand to know who we are, does it not?

65
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:14,090
Very well. Being sensitive to the order in
which one is introduced is old-fashioned.

66
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,893
Also, I would find it mortifying to be
mocked as some official at a sports meet.

67
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,844
What's your point?

68
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,606
You may address me as Shige.
The blood of the Heike flows in me.

69
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,816
I have taken it upon myself to excavate
the buried treasure of the Heike.

70
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,574
Buried treasure? In a place like this?

71
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,701
I can only say that it must exist.

72
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,499
It is for that reason that I cannot
say for certain that it does not.

73
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,454
Have you ever heard that expression before?

74
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:51,509
I must admit, it would be unfair to demand
that you simply take my word for it.

75
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,008
So I offer you this.

76

"Abbreviated Heike Genealogy"

77
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,477
Take a look. This genealogy is proof
that I am a descendant of the Heike.

78
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:06,809
That is why I have every right to
claim this buried treasure for myself.

79
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:12,364
It is common knowledge that the treasure of
the Heike is buried here in the land of Kyushu.

80
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,444
And its location is indicated right here.

81
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,870
A map drawn in invisible ink...

82
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,072
I don't buy it.

83
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,660
Oh, I see that you remain skeptical.

84
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,336
Surely you don't mean to
say that communication

85
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,757
can be built on a foundation of doubt, do you?

86
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:35,133
Also, it is trivial statements
which give rise to the gap

87
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,715
between your generation and mine, young lady.

88
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,886
I have a bad feeling about this. Let's go.

89
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:47,224
Yes, yes. It is the way of the world today to
see other people from only one perspective,

90
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:52,153
rejecting all other possibilities in
the form of making up your mind.

91
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,821
It cannot be helped.

92
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:59,528
However, does one not need
money to keep oneself fed?

93
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,864
It has been five years
since we began our search.

94
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,204
And now, travelers appear just as we
are about to reach the buried treasure.

95
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,084
Surely, the hand of fate is at work here.

96
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:14,714
Perhaps you would care to assist us,
as we are shorthanded at the moment.

97
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,715
What'll you pay us?

98
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,139
Ten percent of the treasure once we find it.

99
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:26,187
That is gold enough to fund the
restoration of an entire country.

100
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,435
Even ten percent would be a large sum.

101
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,565
Wait a minute! We don't have time for this!
We need to get to Nagasaki.

102
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,738
If you are going to Nagasaki,
then you need it all the more.

103
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,690
Battles cannot be fought on an empty stomach.

104
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,779
Do they not say, "Those who do not
work deserve to eat, sleep, and play"?

105
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,364
I guess you got a deal, then.

106
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:51,584
I will have these two show you the way.
I leave them to you, Sabini. Fuupa.

107
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,665
Yes, master.

108
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,503
Geez, why does this always happen to us?

109
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,054
We're only doing this
for a little while, got it?

110
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,766
You needn't be in such a hurry.
Make yourselves at home.

111
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,723
After all, there is no escape from this place.

112
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,659
There's something fishy about that Shige guy.

113
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,329
At the very least, we will save several days'
worth of lodging and food expenses.

114
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,578
If we find the treasure,
let's snatch it and hightail it outta here.

115
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,627
That map was kinda suspicious, too.

116
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,546
Anyway, how about something to eat?

117
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,339
Um, about that...

118
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,337
You've got some food, right?

119
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,510
If you don't mind eating these...

120
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,340
Hey, wait a minute!

121
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,806
--What are these things?
--They're wasabi.

122
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,234
In recent years, it has been
said that life here on Earth

123
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:03,569
sprang from organisms that
were brought here by meteors.

124
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:11,251
No one can deny that unknown viruses
or organisms might lurk in these meteors

125
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,579
that have traveled here
from the far reaches of space.

"Superdimension Period Drama Samurai Champloo "

127
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,975
This is Penta, a self-professed psychic.

128
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:32,431
It was he who divined the
location of the buried treasure.

129
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:38,612
Explosives were then planted in the bedrock
that blocked the way to the treasure.

130
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,365
I can only say that it must exist!

131
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,918
Damn it, that bastard's working us like dogs...

132
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,915
You've got nobody to blame but yourselves.

133
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,376
Hang on for just a while longer.

134
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:05,555
The dowsing rods apparently picked
something up just beyond that bedrock.

135
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:13,272
Huh? I could have sworn
his right arm was cut off...

136
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,687
Maybe I imagined it.

137
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:02,066
Hey, how many days have we been here?

138
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:07,279
It feels as if it's been several days,
or it could be several months.

139
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,113
You lose track of time when you're working here.

140
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:15,746
Once we get that treasure, the five years
that we've spent here will come to an end,

141
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:20,831
along with the rule of those impudent Genji.

142
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,835
Genji?

00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,089
I swear... " Onwards to Kamakura, " my ass.

144

145
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,547
Kamakura?

146
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,351
Um... We're in the Tokugawa Era now.

147
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,679
Okay, let's take a quick break.

148
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,309
Yeah.

149
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,686
Come on, don't the people here
seem a little strange to you?

150
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,692
I mean, how can they live
off of nothing but wasabi?

151
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:51,403
As I recall, wasabi has antibacterial and
preservative properties, but even so...

152
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,973
Hey, I could swear that those two guys were...

153
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,265
They're rotting?!

154
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:21,726
I can't believe it... They're eating wasabi
to keep their bodies from rotting?

155
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:35,284
What do you think? Is this not the perfect place
to forget the troubles of the floating world?

156
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,331
Who are you people?

157
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:45,666
My goodness. That's quite a
philosophical question that you are asking.

158
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,467
Who am I, indeed?

159
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,672
I was hoping to learn the answer to that myself.

160
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,351
Master. As expected, we simply
don't have enough manpower.

161
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,018
I have no choice, then.

162
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,940
I will go summon reinforcements. Excuse me.

163
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,080
I'm beat, I'm beat...

164
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,331
I have heartburn again...

165
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,053
Now that he mentions it,

166
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:38,761
maybe those weren't matsutake
mushrooms that they ate back then.

167
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,938
This is fishy... Are you two also...?

168
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,525
What's her problem?

169
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,655
Come to think of it,
something has been bothering me.

170
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,953
Didn't that Heike family tree
seem suspicious to you?

171
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,625
Beats me. If that's what's
bothering you, it's in here.

172
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,543
Shall we take a look?

173
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,183
Damn thing looks like a game of ladders.

174
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,442
Geez, I'm hungry...

175
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,446
I guess I'll try some of this.

176
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,338
No!

177
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,428
Nooo!

178
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,607
Nooo!

179
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,448
H-Help me!

180
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,663
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

181
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,186
Well, then. Now that you have
discovered our little secret,

182
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,023
it seems that I have no choice
but to kill you, as well.

183
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:02,157
That's how it's gonna be, huh?
You shoulda said so in the first place.

184
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,786
I woulda been happy to fight
you guys whenever you wanted!

185
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,177
Hey, what's the matter? You done already?

186
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,300
What the--?

187
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,560
What the hell? How come you guys ain't dead?

188
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,442
What's goin' on here?!

189
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,528
Hey!

190
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,827
They're already dead, you see.

191
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,700
It's impossible for you to kill them.

192
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:51,036
Oh, it's all right. I'll bring you
back to life soon enough.

193
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,371
There ain't nothing right about this!

194
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,685
Goodness, that was a close call.
My head was hanging by a flap of skin.

195
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,806
What's this? I don't believe it...

196
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:19,606
Come, join us and let's give those
Genji scum a nasty surprise together.

197
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,948
What're you talking about?

198
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,908
Don't you get it?! This is the Edo Era!
The Heike and the Genji are both gone!

199
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,912
What did you say?

200
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,087
You think you've been digging here for five
years, but you've really been at it for 500!

201
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,668
Don't you guys even realize
that you died a long time ago?

202
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:51,521
You stupid little girl... Just listen
to the nonsense you're spouting!

203
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,268
Just a minute!

204
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,522
Take a close look at this.

205
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,274
This family line here.

206
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,571
Hey, it's not connected... But that means--

207
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,326
You're totally unrelated!

208
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,035
Yes. You are not a descendant of the Heike.

209
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,665
You lie!

210
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,465
It's not connected...

211
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,544
--You're not related. Not one bit.
--That's too bad.

212
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,597
It can't be... I've been digging for so long...

213
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,642
After all I've gone through...
All of my hard work...

214
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:33,972
It was all for nothing? All of it?!

215
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,854
It can't be!

216
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,700
At this point, the matter of
whether or not I'm related by blood

217
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,902
is a moot question, don't you think?

218
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:52,707
After all, we don't have a drop
of blood left in our bodies, anyway.

219
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:58,629
Why don't we forgive and forget, let bygones
be bygones, and carry on as before?

220
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,208
Not gonna happen, huh?

221
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,964
No?

222
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,095
Thank you for watching!

223
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,242
A mushroom!

224
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:35,204
"The End "

225
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,833
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

226
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,883
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

227
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:52,100
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

228
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:56,680
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

229
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:01,731
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

230
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:06,982
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

231
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:12,161
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

232
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,828
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

233
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:23,082
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

234
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:28,007
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

235
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:33,137
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

236
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:38,062
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

237
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,355
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

238
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:48,698
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

239
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:53,778
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

240
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:58,499
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

241
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,875
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

242
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:07,459
My dreams becoming...

243
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:13,260
"Shige"
