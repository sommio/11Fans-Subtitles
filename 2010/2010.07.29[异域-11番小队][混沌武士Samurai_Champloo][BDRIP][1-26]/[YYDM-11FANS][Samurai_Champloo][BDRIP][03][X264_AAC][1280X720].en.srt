1
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,842
Showin' your back to me, huh?

2
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,720
You're lettin' your guard down a
little too much, don't you think?

3
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,860
What're you two doing?

4
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,863
Our morning... workout.

5
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,827
Geez, what is it with you two?

6
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,909
Why do you two have to attack
each other for no good reason?

7
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,165
Don't you have anything better to do?

8
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,794
Geez... You two owe me your lives, remember?

9
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,627
I'm not gonna have you two
break your promise to me, got it?

10
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,303
Until we find the samurai
who smells of sunflowers,

11
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,551
a ban on fighting is in effect, understand?

12
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,974
Geez...

13
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,473
I mean, I have absolutely no idea why it is

14
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,521
that you two have to go and do
all that pointless physical exertion

15
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,645
when we're almost starving to death.

16
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,775
Plus, I haven't had a bath in ages.

17
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,777
My good looks are gonna be ruined.

18
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,824
In the first place, I...

19
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,322
Huh?

20
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,449
What're you two guys up to? That's so creepy.

21
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,498
Y'know, you've really got a
good head on your shoulders.

22
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,246
--Am I right?
--Right.

23
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,827
What? I'm not sure if I like this...

24
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,787
You're something else, I gotta admit.

25
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,089
A girl like you, you'll make it
just fine on your own.

26
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,666
--Am I right?
--Right.

27
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,752
What brought this on?

28
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,802
What we're sayin' is...

29
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,845
Huh?

30
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,719
Best of luck to ya, sister!.

31
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,891
Hey, wait a--

32
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,934
You've gotta be kidding me!.

33
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,779
" Hellhounds for Hire (Part 1)
(Tacit Understanding)"

34
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,289
Welcome, sir!.

35
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,921
I'll sit here.

36
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,719
Sir, there are plenty of other--

37
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,679
S-Sir!. What do you think you're doing?

38
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,640
These are... made men,
if you follow my meaning.

39
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,896
Huh? They're yakuza?

40
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:04,741
Yakuza? Aren't they those guys who can't even
take a piss without the whole gang there?

41
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,783
Say what, you punk?!.

42
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,864
Don't you know who we are?
We're the Nagatomi Gang!

43
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,576
Then don't be such tightwads.
You are yakuza, aren't you?

44
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,716
--M-My hand!
--You little punk!

45
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,675
I wouldn't do that.
I'm hungry and in a nasty mood.

46
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,261
It might cost you more than a hand.

47
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,811
What did you say?!

48
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,311
Let's see you laugh it up when you're dead!

49
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,778
Why, you little...

50
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,571
Hold it.

51
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,819
B-Boss?

52
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,245
Can I treat you to something that tastes better?

53
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,413
You've got strength,
and you've got guts to spare.

54
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,914
I like you.

55
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,620
B-But, Boss!

56
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:03,584
Can't you see? You're no match for this man.

57
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,921
I wouldn't mind some of those
crab things, if you got any.

58
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,631
Come with me.

59
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,603
Place your bets, place your bets!

60
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,430
--Even!
--Odd! Odd!
--Even!

61
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,357
Place your bets!

62
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,273
--Odd!
--Odd!

63
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,650
This time, for sure... It'll come up even!

64
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,571
Play!

65
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,323
Two-five, odd!

66
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:40,584
Now, then... I think it's about time
that you paid what you owe.

67
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,585
Aren't there any crabs?

68
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,260
Just be patient. This is my place.

69
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,428
All right, place your bets, place your bets!

70
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,474
Even! I'm on even!

71
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,393
--Mine's on odd!
--Even!

72
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,562
It'll come up a pair. Even.

73
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,154
I'll bet my money on one more thing.

74
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,606
Huh?

75
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,614
Before too long, status and title
won't mean anything in this country.

76
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,368
It'll become so that only
those with power will win.

77
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,994
Play!

78
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,666
Six-six, even!

79
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,293
My intuition is never wrong.

80
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,345
All right, Sousuke, who was
the founder of Confucianism?

81
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,638
Sousuke?

82
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,021
Huh? Um... What was it, again?

83
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,774
For goodness sake, you were the one
who asked me to tutor you, Sousuke.

84
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,698
You bastard! You're a
funny guy, aren't you?

85
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,652
And they don't send me
to run kids' errands.

86
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,659
P-Please, have a heart...
Take anything but my store--

87
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,743
Say what? What's the big idea,
losing and not being able to pay up?

88
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,623
T-That game was fixed--

89
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:06,002
You really shouldn't slander other
people's reputations like that.

90
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,131
If you have any proof,
would you care to show it to me?

91
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,506
Father?

92
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,214
G-Go back into the other room!

93
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:18,928
If you can't pay, maybe we can
take something else in its place?

94
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,314
Welcome, sir. What can I get you?

95
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,492
Actually, shopkeep, the thing is, I...

96
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,572
You aren't going to tell me that
you have no money, are you?

97
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,828
Oh, not again...

98
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,252
I just had a penniless drifter
pass through here a while ago,

99
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,580
...and he caused a huge commotion.

100
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,883
Do you know of anywhere around here
where a man might earn some money?

101
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,336
I can see that you're a sword for hire.

102
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,422
You came to town at
just the right time, then.

103
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,634
This town has been the turf of a
yakuza group called the Kawara Gang

104
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,684
for as long as anyone can remember.

105
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:06,233
Well, they're called yakuza,
but their boss is a kindhearted man

106
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,184
known as Heitaro the Buddha.

107
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,521
We lived in peace for what seemed like forever.

108
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:16,155
But ever since an upstart group called the
Nagatomi Gang showed up six months ago,

109
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,613
this town has completely changed.

110
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,955
" Kawara "

111
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:24,576
Is there nothing you can do, Heitaro?

112
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,835
If nothing is done, the cabinetry business I've
owned for all these years will be taken over...

113
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,462
Raise your head, Daigorou.

114
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,636
It's true that you and I have known
each other for a long, long time.

115
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,931
And O-Suzu there looks after my son.

116
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,805
I would like nothing better than
to do something to help you,

117
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:47,266
but with no proof of cheating,
we mustn't launch a raid against them.

118
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,727
But, Boss! Daigorou isn't the only one!

119
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,780
One by one, everyone in town
is being swindled at gambling!

120
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,576
We're losing everything to the Nagatomi Gang,
even our stores and our daughters!

121
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,825
If this keeps up, they'll gain
control of our entire territory!

122
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,870
Boss!

123
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,665
--Boss!
--Boss!

124
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,503
"Crab Dojo "

125
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,639
In the end, it's the fate of the weak
to be eaten by the strong.

126
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:24,140
I've risen to where I am by devouring
such people one after the other.

127
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,815
Everything around here that's worth
calling a town already belongs to me.

128
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,941
And now, I've come here to take over this town.

129
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,776
Damn, this is hard!

130
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,949
You're an interesting man.

131
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,078
What do you say? Will you join forces with me?

132
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,079
Huh?

133
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,005
With my money and organization combined
with your strength, we'll have nothing to fear.

134
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:56,631
How about it? Want to take over
the whole country with me?

135
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,508
That game back there...
It was rigged, wasn't it?

136
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,009
What?

137
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:05,640
Isn't this "take over the whole
country" speech a sham, too?

138
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,230
And that's the situation.

139
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:14,107
Well, whoever wins,
it's got nothing to do with me.

140
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,687
I said that I have no money.

141
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,273
If you're looking for a way to make quick money,

142
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,611
go get yourself hired as a bodyguard with
the Nagatomi Gang. They've got plenty.

143
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,158
Speak of the devil... That's them.
It's the Nagatomi Gang.

144
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,787
Welcome, sirs.

145
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,668
Hand over that I.O.U.!

146
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,298
Well, well! And who do we
have here? It's Kawara junior!

147
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,758
You've got an I.O.U. for O-Suzu! Hand it over!

148
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,522
Damn it! He only owes you money
because you cheated him out of it!

149
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,439
What's gotten into you, little boy?

150
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:57,021
If you're thinking of standing up
to us, come back in ten years!

151
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,151
G-Give it back!

152
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:04,119
Go home and suck some milk
from your mommy's tit, boy!

153
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,323
You there. Boy.

154
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,918
Want to hire a bodyguard?
I'll show you my skill right now.

155
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:16,964
Say what?!

156
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,339
Stay out of this, you third-rate samurai!

157
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,686
Give me that...!

158
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,607
Give me... the I.O.U.!

159
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,652
Fine, I hope you choke on it!

160
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,354
You'll pay for this!

161
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,620
Honestly, I can't believe those two.

162
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,747
How could they abandon me
and run off like that?

163
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,123
Fine, see if I care!

164
00:11:55,215 --> 00:12:00,551
I don't need them! I'll look for
the sunflower samurai by myself!

165
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,801
I'm so hungry...

166
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,634
You there.

167
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,094
You appear to be searching for something.

168
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,272
Yes, yes, that's exactly right!

169
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,351
You're searching for two men, I see

170
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,777
Two men?

171
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,150
Oh, you mean them.

172
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:31,703
Um... This is all I have, but could
you tell me where to look?

173
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,500
Well, I suppose I could give you a hint.

174
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,542
I would beware of vases if I were you.

175
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,169
Vases?

176
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,758
Big bro!

177
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,803
What's the matter? You're as pale as ghosts.

178
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,721
A bodyguard, you say?

179
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,642
Yes, sir! And a damn tough one, at that!

180
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,061
He was so fast that I didn't
even see him draw his sword.

181
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,106
So he beat you, and you came
running back here, crying like babies?

182
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,058
Y-Yes, sir...

183
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,937
Sounds interesting.

184
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,865
Okay, I'll take care of this job for you.

185
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,739
You will, huh? I'm glad to hear it.

186
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,288
Just a minute, sir. If it's
muscle you need, I can--

187
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,833
That man isn't anything
as lowly as hired muscle.

188
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,785
He's a partner.

189
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,667
Hey.

190
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,000
This gang doesn't need two skilled men.

191
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,461
The survivor will protect this gang.

192
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,092
Draw!

193
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,531
Y'know, fighting you might
be a little interesting...

194
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,001
Interesting...

195
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,424
That's enough of that.

196
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,500
Huh?

197
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:10,760
Ishimatsu, go grab that
cabinet maker's daughter.

198
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,387
B-But, boss! You could send
one of the younger guys to--

199
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,844
Don't you know how to follow orders?

200
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,862
Thank you. Thanks to you, I can--

201
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,693
Huh? Hey, wait!

202
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,781
I'll talk to my father, so please
work as our bodyguard.

203
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,582
What's that sword for?

204
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,534
That isn't a toy.

205
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,497
If they had cut you down back there, you
wouldn't have had any right to complain.

206
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:48,301
If you aren't prepared to die,
don't swing such things around.

207
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,424
Excuse me.

208
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,722
Don't make fun of me just because I'm a kid!

209
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,767
I'm... I'm the--

210
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,607
I-I'm so sorry!

211
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:11,441
On, no... This is terrible. Can you pay for it?

212
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,824
I'm asking if you can pay for this broken vase.

213
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,903
Vase...?

214
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,238
Um... How much is it?

215
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,325
A hundred ryo.

216
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,584
That's no good! You can't go around breaking
people's things if you can't pay for them!

217
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,666
What's that I hear? You need 100 ryo?

218
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,670
Um... Yes.

219
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,004
Then this is your lucky day.
I have the perfect job for you.

220
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,635
Really? You do?

221
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,894
What? What're you doing?

222
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,312
No!

223
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,939
O-Suzu!

224
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,146
No, stop!

225
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,526
O-Suzu!

226
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,154
We're not going to take her
away and eat her or anything.

227
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:58,454
We're just going to have her
work off your debt, that's all.

228
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,125
W-Wait! I'll pay you your--

229
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:07,501
Now, now. You need to take
that up with the Kawara Gang.

230
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,210
This isn't just about your family anymore.

231
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:18,176
They're the ones who hired themselves
a bodyguard and stole back your I.O.U.

232
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,024
Ishimatsu!

233
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:31,150
I don't work for you anymore, Heitaro.

234
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,232
I'd appreciate it if you
wouldn't be so informal.

235
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,033
Come on, let's go.

236
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,127
That hurt...!

237
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,125
Hey, what the--

238
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,208
You're going to work until
you've earned that 1 00 ryo!

239
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,793
Huh? Wait a minute,
are you telling me that this is a--

240
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,800
It's a brothel, of course.
What were you expecting?

241
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,552
You're kidding me...

242
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,310
Dad, listen to this.

243
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,935
Is that the bodyguard I've heard about?

244
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,358
Where is the I.O.U.?

245
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,652
You little fool!

246
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,277
O-Suzu's been taken away to the brothel.

247
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,404
It happened just a few minutes ago.

248
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,282
--I can't believe it...
--You must have known.

249
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:24,082
An eye for an eye. That's how they do things.

250
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:28,787
That's why I've held my peace all this time.

251
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,587
Boss, we can't put up with this any longer!

252
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,586
Let's raid their place!

253
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,760
If we went now, we'd be
playing into their hands.

254
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,713
Anger only gives rise to further anger.

255
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,925
It's a cycle that never ends.

256
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,635
I'll have to ask your guest to leave as well.

257
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,847
The Kawara Gang has no need of a bodyguard.

258
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,684
So it doesn't bother you that
they're walking all over us?!

259
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,770
You're telling me to leave
O-Suzu in that place?!

260
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,106
You're always like this, Dad!
You always want to keep your hands clean!

261
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,739
It's always " not spilling blood " this
and "the trust of the townspeople" that!

262
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,038
That might have worked when we were at peace,

263
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,617
but those days are over now!

264
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,751
Let's go. If the Kawara Gang won't
hire you as a bodyguard, I will!

265
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,251
I forbid it!

266
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,549
I'm gonna smash all of those Nagatomi bastards!

267
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,718
Sousuke! I forbid it!

268
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,341
Sousuke!

269
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,806
You're new here, too, aren't you?

270
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,308
Yes. How did you--

271
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,857
You seemed really depressed, that's why.

272
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,525
C'mon, cheer up.

273
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,774
We'll work something out. Both of us.

274
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,823
You're strong, you know that?

275
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,820
I'm hopeless, though...

276
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,824
I know that I have to do this
because of father's debts, but...

277
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,580
" Narita-ya "

278
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,668
Damn it... Their security is really tight.

279
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:03,348
The fact that both our faces are known
will make getting in very difficult.

280
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,970
I've got it!

281
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,730
I don't think you guys have time
to fool around with women...

282
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,432
Don't be in such a rush.

283
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,735
You can rest assured that the
Kawara bodyguard will come here.

284
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,780
That's why I used the bait I did.

285
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,483
Why go to all this trouble?

286
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,945
It'd be quicker to just storm his
place and trash 'em all, wouldn't it?

287
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,577
That's the old way of doing things.

288
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,456
You don't crush opponents.
You declaw them and take them over.

289
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,332
Think about it.

290
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,712
If we started a big fight with them
and people become afraid of us in town,

291
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,714
we'd lose our customers.

292
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,591
And if we caught the
attention of the government,

293
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,889
we'd have trouble even doing business.

294
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:49,719
That's why I try to take
them over using legal means.

295
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,772
I ain't exactly the patient type.

296
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,316
Go get laid or something, and the time will fly.

297
00:19:56,404 --> 00:20:00,192
We were wondering if there
might be work to be had here...

298
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,273
I don't know...

299
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,529
That's one huge woman...

300
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,235
May we come in?

301
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,912
Go inside and wait over there.

302
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,662
You look pretty good in that.

303
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,667
I'm uncomfortable with this.

304
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,301
Go ahead and pick whichever one you want, too.

305
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,300
Hey, I know! You, the woman over there!

306
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,554
Let's hear you play something on that shamisen.

307
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:52,080
Crossdressers... I mean, we've got intruders!

308
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,535
That's him! That's the Kawara bodyguard!

309
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,244
He's here, huh?

310
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,378
O-Suzu!

311
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,347
Why am I not surprised...?

312
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,845
What is your business here?

313
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,599
What the hell are you doing here?

314
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,432
What the heck are you two doing?

315
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,768
What about your promise not to kill each other?!

316
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,070
This just means that no matter
how hard we try to split up...

317
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,114
...it was always meant to turn out like this!

318
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:50,761
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

319
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:56,013
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

320
00:21:56,106 --> 00:22:01,191
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

321
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,859
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

322
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:12,157
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

323
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,079
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

324
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:22,163
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

325
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:27,093
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

326
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:32,386
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

327
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:37,729
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

328
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:42,809
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

329
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:47,530
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

330
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:51,905
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

331
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,955
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

332
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:04,081
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

333
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:12,422
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
