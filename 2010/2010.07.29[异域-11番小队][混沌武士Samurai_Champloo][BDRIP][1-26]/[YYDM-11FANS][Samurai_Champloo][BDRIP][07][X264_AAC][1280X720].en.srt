1
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,101
Place your bets, place your bets!

2
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:51,104
This is the last of our savings,
got it? Be careful with it!

3
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,400
Bet on three!

4
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,569
Don't be stupid. Five.

5
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,113
You do everything you can to
get on my nerves, don't you?

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,610
That's my line.

7
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:02,240
You bastard... One of these days,
I'm gonna make you cry uncle.

8
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,198
Cry uncle? Does anyone actually say that?

9
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,748
I've never heard that expression.

10
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,419
--Say what?!
--Hey, this isn't the time!

11
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,086
Let's play!

12
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,966
No way! We actually won!

13
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,590
Awesome!

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,672
I could have sworn that an animal--

15
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,758
No, it must be my imagination.

16
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,478
"A Risky Racket (Surrounded on all Sides)"

17
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,102
Welcome!

18
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,479
--Tempura noodles for me!
--Shippoku noodles!

19
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,526
Hanamaki noodles for me. With a
double order of shrimp tempura.

20
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,572
Got it! Coming right up!

21
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,991
Our first food in three days...

22
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,445
We'll be doing more than smelling it this time!
We're gonna be able to eat it, too...!

23
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:51,081
--Hey, watch it!
--That's what you get for spacing out!

24
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,456
What a jerk!

25
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:56,131
Thanks for waiting! Three bowls comes to 50 mon!

26
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,924
--Here we go!
--Good.

27
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,797
Hey, now, pay up front.

28
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,049
Sure, sure, not a problem.

29
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,182
--Huh?
--What's the matter?

30
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,884
C'mon, pay the man.

31
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,140
I can't believe it!

32
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,314
I've been pickpocketed!
It was that guy just now!

33
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,937
Say what?!

34
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,899
Where'd the bastard go?!

35
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,568
Hold it.

36
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,904
Excuse me?

37
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,488
My apologies.

38
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,243
Bastard!

39
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,077
Son of a--

40
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,912
W-What's your problem?!

41
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,998
Ouch...

42
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,924
Wrong guy...

43
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,174
Geez! What's the big idea,
beating up innocent people?

44
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,133
Piece of cake.

45
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,608
You dumbass!

46
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,903
Look at you, clutching your wallet
and looking around nervously!

47
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,153
It's the same as shouting, " Look at me,
I'm carrying something valuable! "

48
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,825
I-I'm sorry, big guy...

49
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,404
I swear, I've never seen
anybody as stupid as you.

50
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,241
Listen, it's times when you're
carrying something this valuable

51
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,795
that you gotta walk along with a look on
your face that says it ain't worth anything.

52
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,713
--Hey, watch it!
--Sorry, buddy!

53
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,792
Watch where you're going!

54
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,219
So anyway, you do it like--

55
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,806
--It's gone!
--Huh? What's gone?

56
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,011
That little punk!

57
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,639
You idiots, what're you standing
around for?! Go after him!

58
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,520
Y-Yes, sir!

59
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,820
C'mon, let's give up already. It was
money we won by gambling, anyway.

60
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,522
No way in hell.

61
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,905
A man can't fight on an empty stomach.

62
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,155
There's no sign of him!

63
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,453
Big guy! He's not over here, either!

64
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,829
You morons! Are you trying
to ruin my reputation?!

65
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,161
If the boss finds out about this,

66
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,588
cutting off all the fingers on both my hands
won't be enough to make up for it!

67
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,470
I don't believe it...

68
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,609
Hey! Where the hell are you, you little punk?!

69
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,357
Get your ass out here!

70
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,190
Hey, does a young guy live here?

71
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,197
You people barge into a
stranger's home without asking...

72
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,244
Have you ever heard of the word " manners"?

73
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,245
Besides, I don't have a son.

74
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,793
I'll have to ask you to leave!

75
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,960
Our apologies.

76
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,341
--Any luck?
--He isn't here.

77
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,048
--Must've been a bogus tip.
--Oh...

78
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,351
We'll go give the area another once-over.

79
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,053
You stake out the place from over there.

80
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,230
What? By myself?

81
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,773
--Yes.
--Good luck.

82
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,647
Hey, wait!

83
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,424
Hey, this is the real deal!

84
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,379
Shinsuke, what are you doing
with something this dangerous?

85
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,964
I need the money.

86
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:38,304
Let me think... My broker fee will be 70.
I'll fence it for you for that much.

87
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,559
Seventy percent?! You're kidding!

88
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,859
You can't go through legal
channels with this, you know?

89
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:50,612
Besides, how would a rookie like
you be able to fence this? Huh?

90
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,067
All right.

91
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,950
Come back tomorrow. I'll have
the deal set up by then.

92
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,541
Shinsuke?

93
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,469
What, you're still up?

94
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,012
Have you been out working until this hour?

95
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,010
Something like that.

96
00:07:56,101 --> 00:08:00,561
If this latest job works out,
it'll make me a lot of money.

97
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,229
Then I'll be able to buy you better medicine.

98
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,940
A while ago, some strange
men came here to see you.

99
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,489
Who were those people?

100
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,736
Beats me.

101
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,114
Then what did they want with you?!

102
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,116
What're you doing? Don't
overexert yourself. Go to sleep.

103
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,794
Shinsuke, you aren't--

104
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,541
Aren't what?

105
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:33,468
You aren't doing things that would make you too
ashamed to look people in the eye, are you?

106
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:37,798
What're you saying?
I'd never do anything like that.

107
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,180
Don't worry about me,
just worry about your health.

108
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,523
Hey.

109
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,775
See him?

110
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,030
No, no one came.

111
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,827
I guess that's that.

112
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,030
There was a stable up the road, remember?

113
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,956
We'll spend the night there.

114
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,830
Sure...

115
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,063
Who are you?

116
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,691
Um, I'm sorry.

117
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:38,025
Are you... Shinsuke's girlfriend?

118
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,451
--I'm...
--I see...

119
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,996
I suppose he's that age now.

120
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,965
That's so good!

121
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,214
I've never seen anyone look so happy
over eating dried sweet potatoes.

122
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,639
I'm sorry...

123
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,469
--If you don't mind eating
these, eat all you like.
--Yes, ma'am!

124
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:11,399
Still, I'm amazed that he found
himself such an adorable girlfriend.

125
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,475
About that...

126
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,906
He doesn't have a father,
and I have this frail body...

127
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,574
That's given him a difficult life,

128
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:26,373
even though he's really still at that age where
a boy wants his parents to take care of him.

129
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,919
Well, well... So, he's doing
the things that young men do.

130
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,375
Has he talked to you about anything lately?

131
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,256
A-About what?

132
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,054
No, never mind. I'm sorry.

133
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:47,057
It's just that he's seemed
a little strange lately.

134
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,402
I've been giving her this medicine every day,

135
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,105
following your instructions
to the letter, Doctor,

136
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,691
but she isn't getting any better.

137
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,368
I never said that this would cure her.

138
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,448
With this medicine, the best you can hope for
is that she might regain some of her strength.

139
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:15,748
There's nothing I can do. That's all
you can buy with the money you have.

140
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,209
There are better medicines available, of course.

141
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,922
For instance, there's Korean ginseng,
which is said to be a cure-all.

142
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,008
It costs a hundred times as much
as this medicine here, though.

143
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,559
Can you afford something like that?

144
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,557
I'm sorry, but I am running a business here.

145
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,319
Hey, are you the guy they call Hikoichi?

146
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,615
What do you want?

147
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,069
I'm looking for something.

148
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,621
Where'd you hear about me?

149
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,701
It's something that's way too much for
a small-time fence like you to handle.

150
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,126
Oh?

151
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,330
Don't play dumb with me!

152
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,837
I know that pickpocket punk
came to see you yesterday!

153
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,091
I... I don't know who you're talking about!

154
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,057
What do you think you're doing?!

155
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,059
Oh, you'll feel like talking soon enough.

156
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,644
I told you I don't know who he is, didn't I?!

157
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,070
Stop it! Put it out!

158
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,403
See? You feel like talking now, don't you?

159
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,203
Hey, you!

160
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,165
Do you remember who I am?

161
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,878
--Who are you?
--The girl whose wallet you stole!

162
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,967
You can't get away from me.

163
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,094
--Let go of me!
--The hell I will!

164
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,847
--You bitch!
--Hey there.

165
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,268
You're a hard man to find.

166
00:12:56,359 --> 00:13:01,228
You've been a bad boy. You oughta
return what doesn't belong to you, got it?

167
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,778
Who the heck are you guys?

168
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:08,576
Careful, miss. I think you
know what I'll do if you shout--

169
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:12,201
--Help me! Somebody!
--You crazy bitch!

170
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,452
Big guy!

171
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,874
Bastard!

172
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,497
You little--

173
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,462
--What's all the ruckus?!
--Oh, crap! It's the heat!

174
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,096
What's going on here?!

175
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,764
Hey! What are you doing?!

176
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,342
Damn it...

177
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,436
Back off!

178
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,020
Stay away! If you come
any closer, I'll slit her throat!

179
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,443
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

180
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,405
Give yourself up peacefully!

181
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,701
Kiss my ass! Don't come any closer! Got it?!

182
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,831
Do you hear me?! If you come near me,
I'm really gonna kill this girl!

183
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,052
--Hey, you're bleeding!
--Shut your mouth.

184
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,925
But...

185
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,756
It's no big deal!

186
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,511
What do you want us to do, big guy?

187
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,392
Should we storm the place?

188
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,850
Don't be stupid! What the hell are you thinking?

189
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:26,563
We have to get the stuff back
without the cops spotting us!

190
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,377
Are you in pain?

191
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,672
It's nothing.

192
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,718
That look on your face says otherwise.

193
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:55,345
Don't you get it?
If I have to, I'm gonna kill you.

194
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,063
I met your mother.

195
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,864
If she knew you were picking pockets,
I bet it would break her heart.

196
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,533
Did... Did you tell her that I'm a pickpocket?!

197
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,235
Of course I couldn't tell her that.

198
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,788
I don't want to make a
good mother like her worry.

199
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,294
Don't talk like you know what I'm going through.

200
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,670
I do.

201
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,800
You should be grateful that your mother's alive.

202
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,553
Where are your parents?

203
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,560
My father hasn't been around for a long time.

204
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,564
And my mother died a year ago.

205
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:54,652
I disobeyed my mother all the time.
I made her worry about me all the time.

206
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:59,455
All those things that I really wanted
to tell her... That I wanted to ask her...

207
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,033
Now I'll never be able to.

208
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,709
I need money.

209
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:17,140
There weren't any legitimate places
that would hire a kid like me.

210
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,638
The only people who say that
money doesn't matter in this world

211
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,766
are the ones with lots of it.

212
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:27,100
Without money, you can't even buy good medicine.

213
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,858
And that's the ugly truth of the matter.

214
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,109
Attention, criminal!

215
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,907
This is your final warning!

216
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:40,239
If you haven't surrendered within a minute
of sundown, we will storm the place!

217
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,073
Got that?

218
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,912
--What's the deal?
--Well, you see, a girl was taken hostage.

219
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,917
See, there she is!

220
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,043
That little--

221
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,295
This explains why we haven't seen her all day.

222
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,297
Hey!

223
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,505
Stay away! You hear me?!

224
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,262
We found you, you pickpocketing bastard!

225
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,968
Hey, hold it! Where are you going?!

226
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,146
I got unfinished business with that guy!

227
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:14,071
You ought to surrender.
There's nowhere for you to run now.

228
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:18,276
Forget it. I can't get arrested
by those guys, not now.

229
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,113
Then I'll be a decoy!

230
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,201
You run away while I have everybody's attention.

231
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,910
Why would you--

232
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,711
We can't have that.

233
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,461
You're not getting away this time.

234
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:37,763
We don't have time to fool around.
Hand over the stuff right now!

235
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,678
Outta my way!

236
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,475
Who is that guy?

237
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,099
An idiot.

238
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,107
Found ya!

239
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,945
Who are you guys? Move it!

240
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,448
Wait! Let the boy go!

241
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,075
Wha--?

242
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,290
--Big guy!
--Enough of this! Kill 'em all!

243
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,211
You can have it back!

244
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,835
Ow!

245
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,630
--Stop in the name of the law!
--You're under arrest!

246
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,884
You guys are startin' to piss me off!

247
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,511
This way!

248
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,561
My opium...!

249
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,695
Hey.

250
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:41,902
If I ever see you again,
I'll repay you for what you did today.

251
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,404
So...

252
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,741
...don't forget about me, okay?

253
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,418
Same to you! Remember me!

254
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,840
He got away! After him!

255
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,231
Stop in the name of the law!

256
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,979
You can't get away!

257
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,028
Back off! Stay away from me!

258
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,024
Stay away!

259
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,802
Oh, it's you. Is something wrong?

260
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,133
No, I...

261
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,938
Shinsuke hasn't come home.
Did something happen to him?

262
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,936
It's no big deal. I just came by to say hello.

263
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,566
Well, see you. I'll come back later.

264
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,864
He isn't coming back, is he?

265
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,074
He isn't coming back.

266
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:55,001
It's all right. Deep down,
I've always expected it.

267
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,921
I had a feeling that something
like this would happen someday.

268
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:03,001
He was doing something bad, wasn't he?

269
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:08,135
And he paid the price for it,
right? That's why he--

270
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,888
You're wrong. He's-- Shinsuke was--

271
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,496
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

272
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,584
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

273
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,809
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

274
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:57,389
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

275
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:02,440
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

276
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:07,691
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

277
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:12,870
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

278
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,537
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

279
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:23,791
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

280
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:28,716
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

281
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:33,846
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

282
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:38,771
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

283
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:44,064
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

284
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:49,407
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

285
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:54,487
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

286
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,208
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

287
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,538
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

288
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,591
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

289
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:15,764
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

290
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:20,893
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
