1
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:36,252
Okay, you people! Dig the wax
outta your ears and listen up!.

2
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,594
C'mon!

3
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,398
Listen up! If you learn
one thing today, learn this.

4
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,352
I do what other people can't do.

5
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:58,282
Those people who can't,
they say I'm not with it.

6
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,576
Well, they're right. I'm not with it.

7
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,780
All you unwashed masses will
probably figure it out after I'm gone.

8
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:09,585
You'll realize that the man named
Nagamitsu was a real-deal bigshot.

9
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,162
That's the kind of man that you're
gonna go down fighting against.

10
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,748
So let's make sure that you
at least die with some style!

11
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,379
Say your prayers...

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,170
...Jin!

13
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,383
Huh? W-Wait! My name isn't Jin!

14
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,014

00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,189
I wanna take a bath...

18
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,948
Sleeping outdoors is a crime in Edo...

19
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,531
In any case, we have to raise at least
enough money to pay for lodgings...

20
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,706
That's it, I'm done. I can't walk any further...

21
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,413
Welcome.

" Pawn Shop "

23
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,223
What do you think? It's really
cute, huh? It's lacquerware, too.

24
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,175
I can't give you anything for it.

25
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,889
It's scratched here and here,
and the lacquer's wearing off, too.

26
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,020
Do you have anything else?

27
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,479
Sorry, but I don't take anything
unless it's brand-name.

28
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,064
Besides, a sword like that
wouldn't fetch a high price.

29
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,490
Told ya so.

30
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,283
Anything else?

31
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,123
He's gonna hold onto 'em, that's all.
You can get 'em right back.

32
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,165
Forget it.

33
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,585
Don't be such a tightwad. C'mon!

34
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,128
Stop that.

35
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,879
My word!

36
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,094
Ew, gross... What're you doing?

37
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,890
These are very uncommon! Rare items
that you see once in a lifetime!

38
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:56,225
So... How do we go about earning money?

39
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,934
Are you listening?

40
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,034
Big guy?

41
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,337
Hey! Look at that babe. My heart's pounding.

42
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,709
Got it, Shinpachi?

43
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,461
I'm on it, big guy.

44
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,385
Pardon me, would you like a pear?

45
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,593
I think my boss wants to talk to you.

46
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,268
Who?

47
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,060
--He's trying to pick me up?
--Pretty much.

48
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,187
Why doesn't he come over here himself?

49
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,394
Well, the big guy is kinda shy.

50
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,818
No thanks.

51
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,990
Listen...

52
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,289
Forget it, no way. Ask all you want,
the answer will still be no.

53
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,910
This woman is going to take some work.

54
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:01,590
But the thing is, that only makes
her all the more worthwhile.

55
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,167
--Yo, honey.
--Uh, look...

56
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,220
Who, me? I'm a man who's gonna be big.

57
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,797
Believe it or not, big.

58
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,305
No, more than that. Bigger than the biggest.

59
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,851
My name is...

60
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,557
Nagamitsu Sakon Shogen!

61
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,313
This is his idea of shy?

62
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,395
I found him! It's the real deal this time!

63
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,696
You need me?

64
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,241
I'm staying at this address,
so come by, all right?

65
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,661
I'll be waiting for you! Later!

66
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:37,038
Oh, good grief! I swear, it's tough
to be a girl with sex appeal.

67
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:42,088
Being hit on... Well, that's one hassle
that you guys would never understand.

68
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,711
Refill over here.

69
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,219
From the customer over there.

70
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,269
Hey, that lady's pretty hot...

71
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,314
This won't do at all. Water
has more flavor than this.

72
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,566
Just who do you think I am?

73
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,363
Um, who are you?

74
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,113
People call me Budou Kiba.

75
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,695
Grape fang...?

76
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,162
Thanks for the drinks.

77
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:23,122
This won't do. Two fine men
shouldn't be drinking all by themselves.

78
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,083
You need a feminine flower to have a
good time getting drunk, don't you think?

79
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,132
Excuse me...

80
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,179
When that which is given and that
which is received are in balance,

81
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,099
that is when men and women
are bound together.

82
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,221
Would you care to join me for a drink?

83
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,726
Somewhere with a little more atmosphere?

84
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,898
Well, I guess I don't have a problem with that.

85
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,350
What're you talking about?!

86
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,983
C'mon, Jin! Say something, too!

87
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:52,659
I know a place with delicious foreign drinks.
And we won't be bothered there, either.

88
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,452
Hey, lady!

89
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,781
Young women are praised for
their looks, and nothing more.

90
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:03,087
It is only women who are mature in years
who gain respect for being beautiful.

91
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,131
--Shall we go?
--C'mon, let's go!

92
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,708
I swear, it's tough to be a
man with sex appeal, ain't it?

93
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,761
You morons! Fine, see if I care!

94
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,634
Jerks...

95
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,431
I'm gonna go see this guy, you hear?!

96
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,821
So, you're him.

97
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:38,952
The one they call the Glasses-Hunting Samurai
who's been causing trouble around here lately.

98
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,202
An ambush, huh?

99
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,880
But the thing is, those aren't the real deal.

100
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,333
Those glasses of yours are fake!

101
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,217
And that means... that you aren't Jin.

102
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,140
I'll be the first to admit
that I'm a man who will use

103
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,094
whatever's around me as a
stepping stone to become big.

104
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:04,022
Nevertheless... my policy is
to avoid unnecessary fighting.

105
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:08,569
Don't talk so big! I'm here to punish you!

106
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,023
--C'mon!
--You got it, big guy!

107
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,322
Anyway, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do!

108
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,157
Die!.

109
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,290
Big guy!

110
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,047
Way to go, big guy!

111
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:41,886
Midair Finishing Move!
Um... Flying Dragon Sword.

112
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,770
I had it all planned!
Still, it was a needless fight...

113
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,352
So you came after all!

114
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,940
Shall we go forth to Roppongi Hill?

115
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,786
"The European Store"

116
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,283
What the hell is this? It's all red!

117
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,747
It's called grape wine. It's a drink
that comes from beyond the sea.

118
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,719
Delicious.

119
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,549
A beautiful drink for beautiful lips.

120
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:26,138
If you wish to have beautiful eyes,
you should gaze upon beautiful things.

121
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:32,319
No matter how deeply wounded you may be,
there is joy in love that is even greater.

122
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,738
And the instant she manages
to become her true self,

123
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,988
that's when a woman experiences
the ultimate in elegance.

124
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,281
I've been longing for the
warm touch of skin lately...

125
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:50,120
However, my policy is to only drink with boys
who can hold their liquor better than I can.

126
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,001
I think I'll have another.

127
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,127
Top me off, too.

128
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,177
Oh, I see that you're a strong drinker.

129
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,800
Your friend here is awfully quiet.

130
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,507
He's always like that.

131
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,723
I don't feel like going home tonight...

" Hilarious Anime Samurai Champloo "

133
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,882
Do you know why I brought you here?

134
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,302
This area is gonna be my front lawn one day.

135
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,348
And that over there?
That's gonna be my house one day.

136
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,844
Edo Castle.

137
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:49,350
With that in mind, will you
be the Harem of my Heart?

138
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,058
Um... I don't think I follow you.

139
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,314
If you want to know all about me...

140
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,197
...you should take a look at that.

141
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,904
That's my autobiography. A work in progress.

142
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,333
Well, I call it "The Path to Being Big. "

143
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:18,464
Yes, my past, present, and even my
future plans are all written in there.

144
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:24,890
At any rate, I won't be satisfied with being
second or third in anything that I do.

145
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,762
I want to become bigger than anyone else

146
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,220
and make the name Nagamitsu
known throughout the land!

147
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,557
So tell me. Who's the
biggest man in the country?

148
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,766
Gawatoku.

149
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,445
The Shogun Tokugawa, and that's a fact!

150
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,444
And so, I jumped aboard the last
ship from the province of Aki.

151
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,368
I made my way to Edo alone.

152
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:50,074
Along the way, I defeated some
roughneck on his horse on a sandy beach,

153
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:54,958
as well as that Kogarashi bozo,
and my reputation started to climb.

154
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,758
Yes, until the day when people throughout
the land are abuzz with rumors about me,

155
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,335
my final objective is...

156
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,887
Come out and face me, Tokugawa!

157
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,308
I'm too late, huh?

158
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,387
Anyway, there I was, wailing away at what I
thought was Edo Castle, when suddenly...

159
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,148
Uh, mister? That's Osaka Castle.

160
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,522
That's what happened.

161
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,947
Still, because of that,
I met my first follower, Ogura.

162
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:28,448
At around that time, I heard
whispered rumors of a legendary man

163
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,952
who was undefeated in a thousand duels.

164
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,375
And that man's name was...

165
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,204
Enshiro Mariya!

166
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,254
It would've been perfect.

167
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,460
If I could defeat Enshiro and take
over his legend of 1,000 victories,

168
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,134
" Kisarazu Mujushin Kenjutsu Dojo "

169
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,518
I have you now, Mariya!

170
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,561
I'm too late, huh?

171
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:03,572
My perfectly laid plans ran
headlong into a wall that day.

172
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:09,449
I learned from the remaining disciples
that Enshiro had already been killed.

173
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,155
The man who struck down the
legendary, undefeated Enshiro

174
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,208
was none other than his top pupil.

175
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:22,292
A teacher-killer being allowed to assume his
undefeated legend? Isn't that preposterous?

176
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:27,925
After that, I added a new
entry in my autobiography.

177
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,927
Right! This one right here!

178
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:39,229
" For now, slay the betrayer of the
man with the undefeated legend!! "

179
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:39,314
my own legend will echo through the country!

180
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,234
Yo, Nagamitsu!

181
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:46,986
And if I can only make it big,
everything will be within my reach!

182
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,911
When I talk like this, people might think
to themselves, " Nagamitsu is a lonely man. "

183
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,660
I'll admit that I might be lonely.

184
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,209
But I'm alone of my own free will.

185
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,912
And if I'm gonna be lonely anyway...

186
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,124
...I ought to be lonely inside that castle!

187
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:08,086
I've had it up to here with
being lonely inside a tenement!

188
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,091
Big guy!

189
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,891
And that's why you're attacking
every samurai you come across.

190
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,763
Not every samurai!

191
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:20,474
I know that this samurai wears glasses,
which is rare even here in Edo.

192
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,184
Yes! And that man's name is--

193
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,691
J-J-Jin!

194
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,318
Right! Jin!

195
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,196
Um... Gosh, I hope you find that--

196
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,823
J-Jin!

197
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,950
Right, right. That guy.

198
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,999
J-J-Jin.

199
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,169
Well, it's late, so I'm gonna head back.

200
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:46,625
Okay! I'll be waiting for you
here again tomorrow night, then!

201
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,175
Is it a good idea to let her go?

202
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,846
Don't be dumb. I'm taking my time on this one.

203
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,639
What a fine woman.

204
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:58,720
That indomitable spirit in her eyes reminds
me of you-know-who when she was young.

205
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,863
Where could those two have
run off to at a time like this?

206
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,120
Well, bigger doesn't necessarily mean better.

207
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,249
No, that's impossible...

208
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,169
Jin would never do something like that.

209
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,543
" Inn "

210
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,725
You guys!

211
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,390
Aw, quiet down...

212
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,600
My head...

213
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,651
You reek of booze!

214
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,572
That woman...

215
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,699
The bitch rolled us.

216
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,658
Would you two... get your act together?!

217
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,368
Get out there and earn it back!

218
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,256
Okay! Step right up! Take a look!

219
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,255
The two master swordsmen you see before you

220
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:17,136
will amaze you with their
astounding sword techniques!

221
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:22,061
If they succeed, feel free
to leave money in here.

222
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,184
Okay, I've got us a crowd.

223
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,231
So, what're you gonna do?

224
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,325
--You take the bottom one.
--Very well.

225
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,903
I-I'll be fine, I'll be fine...

226
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,193
Hey, I need to ask you something...

227
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,898
Yeah, what?

228
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,868
Well, it's about Jin...

229
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,244
Has he ever told you anything about his past?

230
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:27,828
I don't know anything.
Why don't you ask him yourself?

231
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,294
Well, it's not an easy topic to bring up...

232
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,876
Could he really be a bad person?

233
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,177
" Pawn Shop"

234
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,177
You have her rigged up as a low-rider, I see...

235
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:44,477
Customized palanquins are always lower in value.

236
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,271
Say what? Don't try to take advantage of me.

237
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,225
Old man, you haven't pawned them yet, have you?

238
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,903
Oh, you must have raised some money, huh, sir?

239
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,696
I'll only be a minute.

240
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,785
At this very moment, a door has opened.

241
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,579
And the name of that door is destiny.

242
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,330
You couldn't bear to wait until nightfall to
meet me, so you followed me, didn't you?

243
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,709
Oh, don't feel bad. I understand how you feel.

244
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,962
What's this guy's name?

245
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,014
--Jin. What about it?
--Jin?!

246
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,217
Jin of the Mujushin Kenjutsu school?!

247
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,101
I'm Bunta Ogura, student of
the Mujushin Kenjutsu dojo!

248
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,522
Answer me!

249
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,319
You're right. I am Jin.

250
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:39,274
You traitor! Prepare to pay
for killing our master!

251
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,700
Let's step outside.

252
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,243
Ogura?

253
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,995
No one interfere.

254
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,575
I've looked everywhere for you.

255
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,959
In order to find you, I even became
the follower of a lowlife like that man,

256
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,416
and bided my time.

257
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,341
Why did you betray him?!

258
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,795
Why did a man as great
as you betray our master?!

259
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,223
I wasn't the one who betrayed him.

260
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,268
Even so... I won't make excuses.

261
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,142
In any case, the fact of the matter
is that I was the one who killed him.

262
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,063
Bastard!

263
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,577
Holy crap... Ogura was that tough?

264
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,053
Kill me!

265
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:58,111
But don't forget that lots of students
are out there, and they're after your head.

266
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,689
I've made my peace with that.

267
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:07,370
Tell that to the others like you.
That's why I'm letting you live today.

268
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:11,199
Some day... we'll avenge him.

269
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,659
So, it was all true...

270
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,669
Big guy!

271
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,836
Luigi!

272
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,300
Luigi! It's been so long, Luigi!

273
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,225
What's Luigi doing here?

274
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,565
--O-Sen!
--So there you are!

275
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:40,315
Honey, stop goofing off here.
Hurry up and come home.

276
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:44,695
I'm so sorry about all that.
My husband is a fool.

277
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,150
Hey, wait a minute!

278
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:52,912
Listen, men are all idiots, so make sure
you get them whipped right away.

279
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,993
--Let's go.
--Yes, ma'am!

280
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,710
Farewell, Harem of my Heart.

281
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:04,168
Don't worry, I'll make sure to write
about you in my autobiography.

282
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,673
What do you think you're doing?

283
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,552
Your children are waiting for you
with empty stomachs, so hurry it up!

284
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,633
Y-Yes, dear...

285
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,313
Our money.

286
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,936
I'll forget about Enshiro.

287
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,770
An even better one would be... Musashi, I guess.

288
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,025
He's already dead.

289
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,947
--How about Nobunaga?
--Good idea!

290
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,741
Honestly...

291
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,622
Men are such idiots.

292
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,496
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

293
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,584
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

294
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,809
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

295
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:57,389
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

296
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:02,440
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

297
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:07,691
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

298
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:12,870
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

299
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,537
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

300
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:23,791
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

301
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:28,716
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

302
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:33,846
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

303
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:38,771
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

304
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:44,064
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

305
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:49,407
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

306
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:54,487
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

307
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,208
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

308
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,538
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

309
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,591
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

310
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:15,764
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

311
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:21,894
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
