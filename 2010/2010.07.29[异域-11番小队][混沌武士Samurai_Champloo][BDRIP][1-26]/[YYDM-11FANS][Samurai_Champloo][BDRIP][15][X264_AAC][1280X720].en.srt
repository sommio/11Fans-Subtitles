1
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:48,682
Our three travelers, Mugen, Jin, and Fuu,

2
00:01:48,775 --> 00:02:00,528
continue their long journey
to distant Nagasaki.

3
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:05,365
After they set out from Edo,

4
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,872
they passed through the Hakone Checkpoint.

5
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:14,502
they passed Suruga, they passed Hamamatsu,

6
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,879
they passed Ise,

7
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:24,763
and in spite of various digressions,
have traveled ever westward.

8
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:32,441
And now, overcoming
many trials and tribulations,

9
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:39,695
they arrived at long last
at the Kamigata area.

10
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:58,046
In other words, Samurai Champloo
has now begun its Kansai chapter.

11
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:03,256
We hope you enjoy it!

12
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,430
"Samurai Champloo, Kansai Chapter
Pike in Kansai "

13
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,211
" Bogus Booty (Through and Through)"

14
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,606
These freshwater fish taste
a lot better than I thought.

15
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,943
There's a book called Master of the River
that says they taste bad, though.

16
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,903
Well, I guess they do have a lot of bones...

17
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,339
Jin! Just give up, already!

18
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,762
C'mon over here and join us for lunch!

19
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,808
I'll share my catch with you!

20
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:16,184
Aw, forget him. He's just being
stubborn 'cause he came up empty.

21
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,730
Yeah, but still...

22
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,981
C'mon, before we started fishing, he said,

23
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,154
" Fishing is a life-and-death
struggle between man and fish.

24
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,527
Approach it lightly,
and you are certain to be hurt. "

25
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,825
He actually said that,

26
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,699
and the moron can't even catch fish
that're swimming right in front of him!

27
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,497
W-We shouldn't laugh at him! It's not nice!

28
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,756
Um, do you think we might
have overdone it a little?

29
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,458
--Like I care.
--But he's...

30
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,839
Don't look him in the eye, got it?

31
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,677
W-Where the heck did you get these?!

32
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,228
They were lying at the bottom of the pond.

33
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,725
--They're banko!
--Koban, dummy.

34
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,899
This means we're a filthy bitch.

35
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,021
That's filthy rich!

36
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,194
I hope you're doing that deliberately.

37
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,067
Well, whatever the case may be...

38
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,149
Banzai!

39
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,578
A city! Proper food!

40
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,619
" Udon Noodles "

41
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,331
Boy, I'm stuffed...

42
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,587
For the first time in ages, I'm actually full.

43
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,340
She's some kinda low-grade monster...

44
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,390
? I'm so full, I'm so full,
I'm so full and it's no bull! ?

45
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:37,685
? It's no bull, it's no bull,
it's no bull that I'm so full! ?

46
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:42,482
? Don't be shy, my gut's not shot,
I can eat everything you got! ?

47
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,935
Hey, you guys! Where do
you think you're going?!

48
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,145
Hey!

49
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,354
No women allowed!

50
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,235
What? How come?

51
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,862
This is the red light district!

52
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,568
No way! Darn it, let go of me!

53
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,029
You two traitors!

54
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,991
You jerks!

55
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,500
Welcome, my good sirs!

56
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,082
Please, right this way!

57
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:11,136
Word on the street is that
this is the best place in town.

58
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:15,591
Well, I must say that our girls' looks
and skills are the equal of any Edo geisha.

59
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,848
We like to think of ourselves as
the finest establishment in the West.

60
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,181
We have nothing but the best girls.
There's not a bad one in the bunch!

61
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,813
And our prices are most reasonable.
Our guests have nothing to complain about.

62
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,396
Now, sirs, please make yourselves at
home in this room for a few moments.

63
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,482
I will go make arrangements
for food and courtesans

64
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,862
that are in keeping with your price range.

65
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,075
I can't believe those two jerks...

66
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,912
How could they go to a red light district
when they've got me around?

67
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,842
It sure is tough to be a girl, isn't it?

68
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,092
Hey, are you a boy, Momo? Or a girl?

69
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,971
I'm so hungry...

70
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,139
Welcome, good sirs!

71
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,816
My name is Takigawa.

72
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,649
My name is Seyama. It is a pleasure to meet you.

73
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,906
My name is Yatsuha.

74
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,792
It is a pleasure to meet you.

75
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,837
Sweet! Okay, I'm gonna take this girl here.

76
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,718
The rest of you ladies,
have fun with four-eyes here.

77
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,482
What do you think, sir?

78
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,691
Who are they?

79
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,650
We are unsure of their identities,
but they seem to be a pair of ronin.

80
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,906
And they entered the city today?

81
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,612
So it would seem.

82
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,534
These are the coins that we'd planned
to release in Kaga three days from now.

83
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,710
Why are they circulating already?

84
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,038
Did you fail in your duties, Kakizou?

85
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,671
Yes, sir. I can offer no excuses.
I will submit myself for punishment later.

86
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,502
I am putting together a
report as quickly as possible.

87
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,679
--Hey!
--Yes, sir!

88
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,348
Bring him up!

89
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,895
Who is this?

90
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,977
A man by the name of
Hankichi Otowa who tried to escape

91
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,438
from the underground foundry the other day.

92
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:41,199
We captured him near Ryugakubo,
but he had nothing on him at the time.

93
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,825
However...

94
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,076
However?

95
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:48,786
Just to be safe, we put him under intense
torture, but he never said a word.

96
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,714
It's possible that he's been
trained to withstand torture.

97
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,544
I can't believe it... Are you saying we've been
infiltrated by the Shogunate's secret police?

98
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,924
This is serious... Kakinoji!

99
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,507
--Akame.
--Sir?

100
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,935
Who else started here at
the same time as this laborer?

101
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,105
At the same period, sir?

102
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,434
This man started working at
the foundry about a year ago.

103
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,942
There were four or five others who
started working underground at that time.

104
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,069
As for workers who started
aboveground a year ago,

105
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,367
Yatsuha is the only one I can think of.

106
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,205
I can't believe that Yatsuha could be--

107
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,583
Whether or not you believe it is irrelevant.

108
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,791
Doubts are like flies, they must all be crushed.

109
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,501
--That is our inviolable rule.
--Yes, sir...

110
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:43,511
For the sake of our great cause,
we must be thorough in all things.

111
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,307
There can be no exceptions.

112
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,180
I'll leave the disposal of those
two ronin to you, Kakizou.

113
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:54,359
Turn them into fish food so as
not to raise any suspicions.

114
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:58,438
There was apparently a fat girl
who was accompanying the two men.

115
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,400
Her, too. Track her down and eliminate her.

116
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,950
Yes, sir!

117
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,786
Don't leave any traces whatsoever.
I'm counting on you.

118
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,416
This isn't good...

119
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,216
Whatcha doin', baby?

120
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,965
Oh, nothing in particular...

121
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,172
I don't like being teased.

122
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,430
So, what say we let the good times roll, huh?

123
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,182
I'm paying good money for you, after all.

124
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,559
You have a point...

125
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:57,172
I'm sorry about that, but it looks
like the situation has changed.

126
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,002
It looks like my partner has been captured.

127
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,007
I think I'm in danger, too.

128
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:08,683
I have to go back to Edo
and come up with a new plan.

129
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,512
Boy, this is so irritating...

130
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:15,098
I've been working an undercover investigation
here for a whole year, and now this.

131
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:20,529
See you around, loverboy. If it's in
the cards, maybe we'll meet again.

132
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,857
Damn, that hurt...

133
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,449
You know, I think I could
get into this rough stuff.

134
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,124
H-Hey, wait a minute!

135
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,954
I'm not lettin' you get away again.

136
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,460
Oh, good grief...

137
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:02,024
Now, then... Let's get down to business.

138
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,494
Oh! Look over there! It's a naked woman!

139
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,844
This guy is incredibly tough...

140
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,017
But still...

141
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,313
Tough chicks totally turn me on...

142
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,149
Hey, would you like to do
something really fun with me?

143
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,034
Then let's go to the room next door.

144
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,913
--What do you think you're doing?!
--Who are you?!

145
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,581
No, who the hell are you?

146
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,250
Oh, gosh! There are people here already!

147
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,795
We can't do anything really fun
with these guys in here!

148
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,045
You sons of bitches...!

149
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,798
Beat it!

150
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,013
Hankichi, are you all right? Are you alive?

151
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,728
Yatsuha, is that you...?

152
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,353
I'm sorry, I couldn't outrun them...

153
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,403
These people are no ordinary forgers...

154
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,948
I can't believe that someone
as fast as you couldn't get away...

155
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,070
Who are they?

156
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,324
Probably remnants of the Negoro...

157
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,874
The Negoro militant monks?
The mercenaries from the Warring States period?

158
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,201
You're telling me that they're still around?

159
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,036
We don't have enough men...

160
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:46,170
Yatsuha, go to our master for reinforcements...

161
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,172
It'll be all right. I'll take it from here.

162
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,719
I'll try to come up with something.

163
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,638
I'm sorry...

164
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,056
Now, where were we?

165
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,601
Oh, we can't do anything
really fun in a room like this!

166
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:02,603
Hey, I know! As I recall, there's another
great spot right below this room!

167
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,674
Is this all of them?

168
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,720
Yes, sir. The other one bit off his
own tongue and killed himself.

169
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,136
As I expected.

170
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,931
--Hold him.
--Yes, sir!

171
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,784
I'll have you sing a little for me.
About who sent you.

172
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,346
What's going on?!

173
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,858
Hey.

174
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,404
Hey, what the hell is going on?

175
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,529
Looks like our timing was a little too good.

176
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,569
Who are you?

177
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,165
So, you're the big boss of the operation, huh?

178
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,709
I've finally seen your face.

179
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,458
A spy from the East, huh?

180
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,133
Ginsa Momochi! All of your
misdeeds have been exposed!

181
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,554
Counterfeiting the koban coins of the realm
is the most serious of all serious crimes!

182
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,346
This counterfeiting foundry
is irrefutable proof!

183
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,600
Surrender yourself and come along peacefully!

184
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,816
What's so funny?!

185
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,950
And just who have my crimes
been exposed to? Only you two?

186
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,033
We are the 20-odd descendants
of the Tsuda clan of Negoro.

187
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,665
The clan's mighty warriors are gathered here.

188
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,499
Outnumbered here by the likes of us,

189
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,461
what can mere secret policemen who serve
in a country at peace hope to accomplish?

190
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,139
You have us outnumbered, all right...

191
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,013
...but don't count us out!

192
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:47,564
Hey, if you take out all of these guys for me,
I'll do something really amazing with you.

193
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,392
Are you kidding me?
I'm not falling for that again.

194
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,852
You're on!

195
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,403
Get them!

196
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:05,786
Excuse me, miss. Have you seen a really
fat girl who's about your age around here?

197
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:07,871
Nope.

198
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,169
Sorry to bother you.
Okay, let's check over there!

199
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,712
Yes, sir!

200
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,804
Damn, you're persistent!

201
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,774
Who's out there?

202
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,110
Answer one question.
Where did you get the koban?

203
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,566
As I suspected, that money has a history...

204
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,617
I'm under no obligation to answer you.

205
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,040
My back...

206
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,247
Master Jin...!

207
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,195
This can't be... How did you--

208
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,445
Who are you?!

209
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,778
The daughter of Shogunate secret
service officer, Jinpachi of Iga!

210
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,409
Yatsuha!

211
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,416
Now I see... You're Jinpachi's daughter.

212
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,839
Imagine, the revival of the
Tsuda clan being thwarted

213
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:41,795
by a blood relative of the same clan of
ninja mercenaries that brought us down...

214
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,629
Well, no matter.

215
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:11,078
"Yoshinoya "

216
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:11,949
Thank you.

217
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,252
For the past year, we were hiding here
and secretly investigating these guys,

218
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,421
and we were finally able to arrest them.

219
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,341
We owe it all to you.

220
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,919
That's okay, I don't need no thanks.

221
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:27,882
That is, just so long as
you keep your promise...!

222
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,933
Look! A naked woman!

223
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,907
Yatsuha, are you sure he's gonna be
okay if we leave him here like this?

224
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:52,832
It looked like he had traveling companions.
They'll probably come looking for him.

225
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,504
Come on, let's get moving.
It's a long way to Edo.

226
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,463
I just hope the crows don't eat him first.

227
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,096
He'll be fine. He's not that delicate.

228
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,554
After all, that's the man
who's gonna be my husband.

229
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,513
I'm in love!

230
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:23,696
Bye-bye. Once both our journeys
are over, I'll come find you.

231
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,445
A-Are you serious?

232
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,785
I'm starving to death!

233
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,204
My back...

234
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:39,495
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

235
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,583
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

236
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:51,808
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

237
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:56,388
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

238
00:21:56,524 --> 00:22:01,439
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

239
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,690
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

240
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:11,869
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

241
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,536
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

242
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:22,790
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

243
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:27,715
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

244
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:32,845
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

245
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:37,770
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

246
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:43,063
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

247
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:48,406
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

248
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:53,486
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

249
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:58,207
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

250
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:02,537
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

251
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,590
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

252
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:14,763
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

253
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:20,722
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
