1
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,129
The year is 1 888.

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,006
A lone painter who held a deep admiration

3
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,804
for an ukiyo-e print that
he had encountered in Paris

4
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:46,308
made his way to Arles, Provence in search of
the Japanese sun that he saw in his mind's eye.

5
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:52,394
His dream was to live and work
together with many artists there.

6
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,355
However, only one artist turned up,

7
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,319
and their communal life
didn't even last two months.

8
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,951
The name of the second artist was Gauguin.

9
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,205
The name of the man who was
fascinated by the ukiyo-e print

10
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:13,039
and continually painted
sunflowers was Vincent van Gogh.

11
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,417
"Artistic Anarchy (Falling on Deaf Ears) "

12
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:16,507
Anyway, let's set aside this part
of our tale for the time being...

13
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,551
No way! Are you serious?!

14
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,755
It costs that much?

15
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,966
Well? Are you getting on board or not?

16
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,268
Give me a discount?

17
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:31,474
Forget it. If you can't pay, why don't
you start swimming your way across?

18
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,604
Tightwad!

19
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:38,109
And now, the hands of the clock turn
back more than one hundred years.

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,785
My name is Manzou Sakami.
I'm a secret policeman.

21
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,659
I slice away with no concern
for the edge of my sword.

22
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,164
Because of that, people
call me Manzou the Saw.

23
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,293
The reason I'm here is because
of a rash of disappearances

24
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:59,548
of adolescent girls that has
been taking place in this area.

25
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,716
That's right... Girls a lot like this one.

26
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:09,349
You're such a lifesaver!
Seriously, though? You're paying?

27
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,101
Of course. Go on, eat up.

28
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,309
Excuse me! Twenty grilled
squid with tea on the side!

29
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,315
Coming right up!

30
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,237
That's quite an appetite you have.

31
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,690
--Thanks, buddy.
--We're in your debt.

32
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,650
Give this guy the tab.

33
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,908
--Right!
--Hey, you two!

34
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,831
Get out there and earn our boat fare! Got it?

35
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,785
--Yeah, yeah...
--Right.

36
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,293
Just like that! Right there, don't move...!

37
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,339
What're you doing?

38
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:43,296
I was just thinking that you're
truly a beauty looking backwards...

39
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,803
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Moronobu Hishikawa.

40
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,475
I'm an artist who hasn't
quite made the big time yet.

41
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,179
Pleased to meet you.

42
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,483
"Oh, my!. What a wonderful smile he has! "

43
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,562
Or so these maidens think
as they're so easily deceived.

44
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,817
--It's the girls' soft skin that they're after.
--Oh, no!

45
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,273
Oh, no!

46
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,575
--Oh, no!
--Oh, no!

47
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,284
According to the information
I've uncovered on my own so far,

48
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,490
the vanished girls all have
something in common.

49
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:16,796
They were all amateur
models for ukiyo-e prints.

50
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,374
--She's so hot!
--Hey, move your damn hand!

51
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,422
Who are you?

52
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,971
You're in our light! Move it!

53
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,299
Mess with us, and you're a dead man!

54
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,677
What's your problem?

55
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,353
Draw, you bastard!

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,183
No thanks. Against you guys,
these are all I need.

57
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,142
Say what?!

58
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,576
One, two, three...

59
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,449
Damn, this ain't much.

60
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,155
Start jumping.

61
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,503
I-I'm so sorry...!

62
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,252
Aw, that's sick...

63
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,959
One, two... There's a hair!

64
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,386
We'll remember this, you moron!

65
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,642
Look, this one is mine, too.

66
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,644
I believe that in the future,
ukiyo-e prints will feature amateur models,

67
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,818
not just the star kabuki actors
in the ones we see today.

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,488
Hey, did you paint this one, too?

69
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,785
Yes, of course.

70
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,988
The sunflowers are so pretty...

71
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:39,503
Unfortunately, ukiyo-e are still treated
as cheap pop posters bought by kids.

72
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:44,083
I swear, this country
doesn't understand art at all.

73
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:49,217
It's enough to make me want to
try my hand overseas one day.

74
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,763
Which brings me to my point.

75
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:55,345
Would you be interested in joining me
and entering into the world of art?

76
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,224
--What do you mean?
--It's simple, it's simple.

77
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,397
All you need to do is pose for me.

78
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,270
I'll pay you for your time, too!

79
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,731
Ever since I met you, I've had
a chill running up my spine.

80
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,316
I want to paint you, no matter what.

81
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,651
Well, I don't know...

82
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,736
It's okay, it's okay!

83
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,416
Haven't you seen ships like those before?

84
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,632
I was under the impression that
European ships could only dock at Nagasaki.

85
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,086
They grease the palms of the local governor.

86
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,764
Even if a governor is taken to task for it,
he can say that they were shipwrecked.

87
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:39,313
For one thing, banned European goods
fetch a high price everywhere.

88
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,061
Three-one, Silver General.

89
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,565
My apologies. That was presumptuous of me.

90
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,395
Wait!

91
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,653
What do you say? Care to join me in a game?

92
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,826
Thank you, but I'm in a hurry.

93
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,575
How about if we played for stakes, then?

94
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:59,032
I'd like to, but I don't even
have money for the ferry.

95
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:04,713
If you've got no money to bet,
how about putting your life on the line?

96
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,291
If you win, this money is yours.

97
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,046
If you lose, you pledge your life to me.

98
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,177
I doubt that you're in your right mind.

99
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,556
It's a little joke from an old man
whose life has been spent in the grip

100
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,310
of shogi pieces so light that the
slightest wind could blow them away.

101
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,440
On the other hand,
these gold coins are the real deal.

102
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,691
I will face you, then.

103
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,405
Gimme as many as these will buy.

104
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,236
It's a pleasure doin' business!

105
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,946
Welcome to the shop.

106
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,623
Please feel free to take your time and browse.

107
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,996
I-I'm sorry, ma'am. There's been some trouble...

108
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,502
You three are yakuza!
You're telling me that you were mugged?

109
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,260
I-I'm sorry, ma'am!

110
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,592
Don't get robbed again!

111
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,138
Pick it up.

112
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,939
I'm sorry, ma'am! I'm sorry!

113
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:09,440
The next time you see that guy,
make sure you redeem yourself.

114
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,021
Yes, ma'am!

115
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,238
Oh, crap. The boat fare...

116
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,539
Hey.

117
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,090
Long time, no see.

118
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,752
Hey, hold it!

119
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,509
No way, you bastard!

120
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,464
This is my studio.

121
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,511
Come back here, damn it!

122
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,641
What kind of trouble are you causing this time?

123
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,315
Look who's talking. Why are you
messing around with loverboy here?

124
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:52,647
You've got it all wrong. I came
here to do a modeling job.

125
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,232
Crap, he got away.

126
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,463
It's not quite right...

127
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,017
A little further down... About here.

128
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:36,573
No, no, I'm not saying that to be a pervert!

129
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,446
This is all for the sake of art.

130
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,529
See? You can't see anything from over here.

131
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,455
It's okay, it's okay...

132
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,295
I've been working this stakeout because
I suspected that these incidents

133
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:59,095
were somehow connected to
the European ships in the harbor.

134
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,468
By the way, this is my truncheon blade.

135
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,019
They're normally used as a truncheon,
but when you combine them like this,

136
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:10,941
they make an excellent weight-loss tool
that you can use in your spare time.

137
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,479
As we thought, it looks like a big
deal is going down tomorrow.

138
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,191
Really, now? Good work,
keep up your investigation.

139
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,821
Yes, sir.

140
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,459
--Sir...?
--Well, blow me down!

141
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,082
Who's there?

142
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:44,925
You're pretty good, son.
Where did you learn how to play?

143
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,635
In the dojo.

144
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,096
In both shogi and swordplay,
the key is to read ahead.

145
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:54,025
The battle is decided by whether you can
think farther ahead than your opponent.

146
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,275
That was what my master taught me.

147
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:01,859
I see. It sounds like your
master was a skilled player, too.

148
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:06,663
Yes. I was never able to
defeat him in shogi even once.

149
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,957
What about with swords?
Did you beat him there?

150
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,347
--Finished.
--Really? Let me see!

151
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,273
Great, thanks for your hard work!

152
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,976
What? What's going on?

153
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:41,030
I'm sorry. This is part of my job, too.

154
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,904
Job? What's that supposed to mean?
You tricked me, didn't you?!

155
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,407
Did you have this planned all along?!

156
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,079
Hold still.

157
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,503
Oh, the sun's gone down. Let's pick up tomorrow.

158
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,753
Oops, how clumsy of me!

159
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:15,140
My, that's quite some memory you have.

160
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,444
But this Gold General... Wasn't it up here?

161
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,956
Relax. You'll be out on the sea tomorrow.

162
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,251
Get 'em to take real good care of you.

163
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,626
Hey, did you hear an animal
or something just now?

164
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,957
C'mon, let's go.

165
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,168
You're just imagining things.

166
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,355
Where are you going in such a hurry?

167
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,609
Um, I...

168
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:10,161
You've been so busy with this art nonsense
lately that you never stop by to see me.

169
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:16,369
Who do you think is letting
you live the way you do?

170
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,329
I'm... I'm sorry.

171
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,710
I won't let you go home tonight.

172
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,167
W-Wait a moment!

173
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,806
M-My stomach has, uh, been bothering me all day!

174
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,053
I don't think I'm up to it!

175
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,182
Tomorrow! I promise I'll come see you tomorrow!

176
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,282
I'm getting you out of here.

177
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,331
Okay...

178
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,173
How many girls have you conned so far?!

179
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,460
Answer me! How many?!

180
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,928
At first, I didn't know.

181
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:18,059
I suspected something,
but I looked the other way.

182
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,813
I mean, an ukiyo-e artist could never make
ends meet without doing things like this.

183
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,270
You're just making excuses for yourself.

184
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,570
How could you do that to me?

185
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:35,200
Oh, now I see. You prefer
girls this young, do you?

186
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:41,086
You know what happens to people who
fool with my merchandise, don't you?!

187
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,586
Hey, where is she?

188
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,587
I don't know.

189
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,795
Well, it's not like I care or anything...

190
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,589
Gin.

191
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,613
Man, this won't buy me anything to eat...

192
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,205
Well, well. I still can't capture your piece.

193
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,456
Thank you for your continued patronage.

194
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,257
So, which would you like to buy?

195
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,551
My, you have an eye for quality.

196
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,254
Whoa, check it out,
she's doing it with a squid...

197
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,022
In you go!

198
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:49,483
Geez, if you weren't the boss' young stud,
you woulda been fish food a long time ago.

199
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:54,284
Try anything like that again, and we'll break
your right hand for real. Remember that.

200
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,951
Wakey wakey, loverboy.

201
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,034
Hey. Where'd this girl go?

202
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,919
Help her! If we don't do
something, she'll be sold!

203
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,499
Just accept it, will ya?

204
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,505
Hey, you ready yet?

205
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,178
What the hell? This thing weighs a ton!

206
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,005
That one isn't on the list!

207
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,342
If we don't hurry it up,
she's gonna chew us out again!

208
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,730
When I put a young girl into an ukiyo-e,

209
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,900
the print goes up in a book
rental shop by the harbor.

210
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,571
But the rental shop is just a front.

211
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:38,074
They use the ukiyo-e prints as a slave trade
catalog to sell girls to the Europeans!

212
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,078
We're too late...

213
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,751
She's already been taken away.

214
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,927
Well, blow me down!

215
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,383
Something just popped out.

216
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,514
Who are you?

217
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,722
I must have missed them by just a few seconds.

218
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,825
It's that guy!

219
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,698
Stay away!

220
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,454
Not again!

221
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,392
--Boo!
--S-Spare me!

222
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,779
W-What in the world?

223
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,834
Hold it right there!

224
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,411
You're under arrest!

225
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,124
What's the meaning of this?!
I'm a law-abiding book lender!

226
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,209
Well, blow me down!

227
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,511
As if there could be a
messed-up bookstore like this!

228
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:22,341
I saw through your little scam long ago!

229
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,266
W-What are you talking about?

230
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,641
You've got guts, using your store as a front
to traffic in humans with those foreign ships.

231
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:32,317
This girl and this book
are irrefutable evidence!

232
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,563
Sir...?

233
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,646
Well, blow me down!

234
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,109
Using ukiyo-e prints as a
catalog was clever of you,

235
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,694
but instead it's proved to be your downfall!

236
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,199
Checkmate.

237
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,532
Face the facts and turn yourself in!!

238
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:58,843
Well done. Now I can go with no regrets.

239
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,591
Anyhow, we'll be taking you in now.

240
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,597
Boss!

241
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,727
Darling...

242
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,857
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

243
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,491
As we agreed.

244
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,420
So after all that, it was Jin who earned
our boat fare, even though it looked like

245
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,170
he hadn't been doing anything this whole time.

246
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,876
Hey, I came away with some booty of my own.

247
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,680
Gross! What is this, porn?!

248
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,760
Darn it, you two! Give it a rest!

249
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,643
Hey, backwards beauty!

250
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,689
Now look here--

251
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,564
I'm sorry! I really am sorry for tricking you.

252
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,112
But please believe this one thing.

253
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:06,320
That thrill I felt when I saw you,
that was the honest truth.

254
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:11,499
You were the first. No other girl looked at
my sunflowers and said they were beautiful.

255
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,166
And so!

256
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,505
That makes you my number one fan!

257
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,675
I'm on my way to sneak aboard the European
ships and go to the country of Holland.

258
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:34,856
I won't return to this land until the day
my paintings are recognized as great art.

259
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:40,062
But I'll never forget about you!

260
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:46,117
Oh, right. Don't tell old lady Sawa
where I'm headed, all right?

261
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,443
I appreciate it!

262
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,119
Jerk!

263
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,621
This is ridiculous...

264
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,799
You sure you want to let him go?

265
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:06,346
Yeah, it's okay. I mean, he did
draw me with big hooters.

266
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,888
--Hooters?
--Hooters?

267
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:13,265
After that, the artist who had
attempted to travel to Holland

268
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,641
was caught immediately and deported.

269
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,646
However, the ukiyo-e he had with him
was the one thing that they confiscated,

270
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,648
and it eventually crossed paths with van Gogh.

271
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:27,405
This, they say, is what provided the inspiration
for his series of sunflower paintings.

272
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:31,909
This incident is just one more page
that is missing from the history books.

273
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,370
Well, blow me down!

274
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:35,615
"To be continued "

275
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:50,636
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

276
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:55,888
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

277
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:01,066
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

278
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:05,734
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

279
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:12,032
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

280
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,954
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

281
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:22,038
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

282
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:26,967
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

283
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:32,261
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

284
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:37,604
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

285
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,684
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

286
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,405
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

287
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,780
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

288
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:55,830
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

289
00:22:55,958 --> 00:23:03,956
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

290
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:12,297
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
