1
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,185
You gotta fight fire with fire...

2
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:58,024
B-But OOniwakamaru is awaiting execution!
If he is let out, there is no telling--

3
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,783
This missing arm of mine is mumbling to me.

4
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,959
Kill those bastards for me, it says.

5
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:19,303
Hey, OOniwakamaru. I like that face of yours.

6
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,722
That face of yours that's
lower than an animal's.

7
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:28,520
You and I, we're two of a kind.
No, maybe we're brothers.

8
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,895
So let's go take 'em out, you and me.

9
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,102
Let's take out the people who tormented you.

10
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,124
" Redeye Reprisal (Pandemonium)"

11
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,293
All right? No holding out.

12
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,717
Pull out everything you have,
even your secret stash.

13
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,466
OOne, two...!

14
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,547
You're kidding! This is all we've got?

15
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,349
Hey, now, are you sure
you're not holding out on us?

16
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,018
Look who's talking. What are those acorns?

17
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,183
Hey! You haven't forgotten
your promise to me, have you?

18
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:19,192
Until we find the samurai who smells
of sunflowers, no killing each other!

19
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,195
I've been meaning to ask you about that...

20
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,868
Who is this samurai who smells of sunflowers?

21
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,618
--Well, he...
--And what the hell is a sunflower, anyway?

22
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,698
Hey, wait a minute...

23
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,533
--You don't know?
--It's a flower! A flower!

24
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,913
What do they smell like?

25
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,289
Do you have any other leads?

26
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,292
--Like a picture or something?
--What made you decide to come here?

27
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,999
OOh, for crying out loud!

28
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,926
For now, let's get something to eat, okay?

29
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,357
Ta-dah! Grilled manjuu buns,
the Joushuu regional speciality!

30
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,230
Here is today's question.

31
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,938
How many do we each get if we
split these between three people?

32
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,738
I'll kill the both of you
and eat 'em all myself!

33
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,191
Hey!

34
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,151
What's your problem?

35
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,415
--Hey! Gimme back my buns!
--You thieving bird!

36
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,997
Perhaps this is why they
call that bird a filcher.

37
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,628
What did you say?!

38
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,712
So are you saying that those missing
people were attacked by an ogre?

39
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,263
Yeah, that's what the rumors say.

40
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,841
What a frightful story.

41
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,678
Hey, you're a samurai, aren't you?

42
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,683
Well...

43
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:38,143
--Hey, I know! Go kill that ogre for us!
--Yeah, right!

44
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,945
OOh, but I-I couldn't possibly...

45
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,692
D-Don't startle me like that...!

46
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,279
I guess there's such a thing as
an unreliable samurai, after all.

47
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:55,288
But if the rumors are true, then
right about now, those people are...

48
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,494
Probably being eaten alive.

49
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,204
Hey, my dumpling!

50
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,880
I heard you talking.

51
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,551
What say I go kill that ogre for you?

52
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,024
You're pretty amazing!

53
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,150
You've got some serious skill!

54
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,530
I bet you're a student of
some big-name dojo, right?

55
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,326
Something like that.

56
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,701
Hey! What's with this ogre-slaying business?

57
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,499
Do you think you're a fearless
monster slayer or something?

58
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,703
You're gonna keep your
promise to me, understand?

59
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,005
Now, now, don't get mad.

60
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,923
Why don't you join us?

61
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:50,598
I must say, I'm jealous. f people who
are confident in their skills, I mean.

62
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,518
A man like me is a samurai in name only.

63
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,318
Yum! What kinda water is this?

64
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,192
Wow, you sure know how to throw 'em back!

65
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,279
--Hey, now!
--Um...

66
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,032
...you aren't planning on going through
the mountain pass right away, are you?

67
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,203
Yeah, what about it?

68
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,204
I wouldn't if I were you.
The sun is about to go down.

69
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,503
Perhaps, but we don't have
money for lodgings, so...

70
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,924
Oh, I know! If that's the case,
I know the perfect place for you.

71
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:30,129
There is a shack near
the hot springs up the road.

72
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:35,763
If you like, why not stay there
tonight and set out in the morning?

73
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,897
Sleeping without a care in the world...

74
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,271
I'm gonna rape you, you dumb broad.

75
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,603
That innkeeper back there...

76
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,940
No, I'm reading too much into it.

77
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,843
Good work. You did pretty well.

78
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,893
I-In that case, I'll be...

79
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,143
OOh, right. There's one thing
that I forgot to mention.

80
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,849
Just to be safe, I'm gonna kill you.

81
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,070
Thank you. That was a big help.

82
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,372
I didn't say anything about doing it for free.

83
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,915
How much do you want?

84
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,742
How much will you give me?

85
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:06,267
Well, I got things to see and people to do...

86
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,817
That woman, huh?

87
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,571
Why did you want to see me?

88
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,119
That's a silly question to ask.

89
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,245
When a man and woman are all by themselves,

90
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,917
there aren't all that many things
that they can do, are there?

91
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,164
Damn, lady, you move quick, don't ya?

92
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:34,629
I'm not interested in playing coy.
Let's enjoy ourselves tonight.

93
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:39,467
Nights are like human lives.
They're all too brief.

94
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,907
Hey, there.

95
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,662
I can't have you waking up just yet.

96
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,341
Oh, my. Isn't this a surprise?

97
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,044
You're the man from the teahouse.

98
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,013
Do you know why fireflies give off their glow?

99
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,315
It's the males and females
calling out to each other.

100
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:34,192
However, they say that every once in a while...

101
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,399
...two males attract each other.

102
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,200
If you'll excuse me.

103
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,660
That reminds me.
The truth is, I've heard of him.

104
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:53,215
OOf the samurai. You know, the sunflower
samurai that the young lady spoke of.

105
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,921
Ryujiro Sasaki!

106
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,596
We're Kanto regional law enforcement officers!

107
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,020
Ryujiro Sasaki! You are under arrest
for the arson of a teahouse...

108
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:13,353
...and of the murder of a treasury employee!

109
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,856
Come along quietly!

110
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,236
Geez... You're hard workers, I'll give you that.

111
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:24,196
Say, OOniwaka. These guys came
to pick on you some more.

112
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,200
Who the hell is that?!

113
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,203
It doesn't matter, take him down, too!

114
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,036
You big freak!

115
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,925
S-Stay away from me, you monster!

116
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,120
Don't be afraid.

117
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:10,291
Everyone is afraid of my face.

118
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,836
They say it is ugly.

119
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:18,542
They hate me. They call me a monster.

120
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:24,632
But if I do this, they cannot see my face.

121
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,769
D-Don't look!

122
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,198
I'm not afraid of you.

123
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,578
But... But you have such a sad look in your eye.

124
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:07,303
They called me a monster.

125
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,385
I thought they were going to kill me.

126
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,271
I... I lost control of myself.

127
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,730
I killed... many people.

128
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:27,323
I... am all alone.

129
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,538
A firefly!

130
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,690
I sent him his invitation.

131
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,144
OOkay, OOniwaka, let's get ready for the party.

132
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,254
What the hell did you make me swallow, bitch?

133
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,627
How do you feel?

134
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,459
It was a one-night mushroom.

135
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:30,925
They say that if you wash them down
with sake, they become a deadly poison.

136
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,561
Who put you up to this?

137
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,937
You better start talking before I get
sloppy and accidentally skewer you.

138
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,110
A man with one arm.

139
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,359
He has the antidote, too.

140
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,657
--More importantly, though...
--What?

141
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,907
Right about now, that girl
companion of yours is probably...

142
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,578
Crap!

143
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,908
How much further?

144
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,164
We're almost there.

145
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,923
Damn!

146
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:13,933
I neglected to mention this earlier,
but I'm an assassin.

147
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,681
Yes, I already know that.

148
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:24,269
I'd like you to know
that I bear you no ill will.

149
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,948
Killing is merely a business for me, you see.

150
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,615
Son of a...

151
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,507
Who hired you?

152
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,927
Well, then, perhaps we should get started.

153
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,559
OOh, my! You live up to the rumors.

154
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,863
It's been quite some time since I last
faced a swordsman of your caliber.

155
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,534
Looks like I'll be able to do me
some ogre-slaying after all!

156
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,299
You bastard...

157
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,341
Mugen!

158
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,465
So, you finally turned up, huh?

159
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:35,219
I'm gonna make you regret cutting off my arm.

160
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,597
--What arm?
--Hey, come on, now.

161
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,351
Don't try to tell me that you
don't remember this arm.

162
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,433
Sorry, who are you again?

163
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,439
Y-You little bastard!

164
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,408
Ah, I see... You're better than I imagined.

165
00:15:54,495 --> 00:16:00,081
I must admit, if we were in a dojo,
perhaps I wouldn't be able to beat you.

166
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,749
However...

167
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,800
What's the matter?

168
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,221
Is fighting here different
from fighting in a dojo?

169
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,317
Damn it, my arms are like wet noodles...

170
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,268
Mugen...

171
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,606
What's wrong? Has the poison
finally started to kick in?

172
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:37,410
Do you want this? It's the antidote.

173
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:42,116
With one-night mushrooms, you finally kick off
after spending a night writhing in agony,

174
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,326
just like the name implies.

175
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,083
Which means that you
got just one night to live!

176
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,230
I... am ugly...!

177
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,734
Don't look at my face!

178
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,239
Mugen!

179
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,993
Not yet, OOniwaka! Don't kill him just yet!

180
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,292
I'm gonna make this bastard die nice and slow.

181
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:31,965
OOh, my. I haven't enjoyed myself
this much in quite some time.

182
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:36,294
Nevertheless, my policy is to never
work any longer than necessary.

183
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,347
I'll go ahead and end this, if you don't mind.

184
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,144
Hey, hey!

185
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,069
How ya like that? I bet you can't breathe...

186
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,192
I ain't gonna give you an
easy death, understand?

187
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,946
So suffer some more!

188
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,912
You little bitch!

189
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:15,917
This suits me just fine. I'll start with
sending you to meet your maker.

190
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,424
And you call yourself a human being?!

191
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,256
OOh, that's a good one!

192
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:28,096
Girl, I sold my soul a long, long time ago.

193
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,310
Watching other people suffer,
that's my idea of a good time!

194
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:38,273
I wanna take my suffering
and share it with everybody.

195
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,234
I'd say that's fair, wouldn't you?

196
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,698
So that's why you're gonna die, too!

197
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:54,001
Oniwaka? What are you--

198
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,602
No, don't!

199
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,524
Please, don't do this!

200
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,074
OOh, dear.

201
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:40,297
Goodness gracious.
My client has gone and died.

202
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,298
What?

203
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:45,223
In other words, I no longer
have any reason to kill you.

204
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,224
There's no point in killing someone if I'm
not going to receive money for it, you see.

205
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,895
Well, I'm off.

206
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:01,238
I expect that you and I will meet again one day.

207
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,032
That's the feeling that I get.

208
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:23,678
Why? Why did you protect me?

209
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,379
Why'd you do it...?

210
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:34,682
You... were not afraid of me.

211
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:40,520
I... am not alone.

212
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:50,469
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

213
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:55,721
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

214
00:21:55,815 --> 00:22:00,900
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

215
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:05,567
Winter passes by, and i count off
the days and months again

216
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:11,865
i can still see the too-distant blue sky
when i close my eyes (it was so warm)

217
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,787
As i reminisce, i take your hand
as i pluck flowers and sing

218
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:21,871
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

219
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:26,801
i'm setting out to find my way back to you

220
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:32,094
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

221
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:37,437
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

222
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:42,517
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

223
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:47,238
Winter passes by, and i count off
the days and months again

224
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:51,613
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

225
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,663
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

226
00:22:55,791 --> 00:23:03,789
i turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind i felt every time you held me

227
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:12,131
As i was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
