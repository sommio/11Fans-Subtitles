1
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:37,636
Save Mugen! Please, save Mugen!

2
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,680
What do you mean by that?

3
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,348
So, it's a trap.

4
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,495
Mukuro, you son of a bitch!

5
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,246
You played me, didn't you?!

6
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,918
Oh, crap!

7
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,848
Damn you, you bastard!

8
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,976
Mukuro!

9
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,400
The pirate ship!

10
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,319
What? Which one is it?

11
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,021
Mugen's on it!

12
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,578
Mugen!

13
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,293
" Misguided Miscreants, Part 2
(A Dark Night's Passing, Part 2)"

14
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,037
Mugen...

15
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,839
I can't believe it, he's dead...!

16
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,136
That would never happen.

17
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:06,684
Mugen would never die that easily!

18
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,761
--Calm yourself!
--But we have to...

19
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,641
Calm yourself.

20
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:39,000
In search of new lands

21
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:46,216
I build a new house

22
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:53,351
I thatch the house with reed stalks

23
00:03:53,442 --> 00:04:02,066
Gathered neatly in bundles

24
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,577
With reeds gathered neatly in bundles

25
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:18,923
I thatch the house with reed stalks

26
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:29,931
Gathered neatly in bundles

27
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:37,563
At the stone wall

28
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:44,490
Let us celebrate the golden house

29
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:51,493
That was built by a hundred black kites

30
00:04:51,583 --> 00:05:00,207
Let us celebrate the golden house

31
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,513
That was built by a hundred black kites

32
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:16,939
Let us celebrate the golden house

33
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:28,527
That was built by a hundred black kites

34
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:48,295
It's not right... It's not right
that they' re so beautiful.

35
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,803
Not when we're this sad down here.

36
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,976
They can't see anything up there.

37
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,102
Looking down from up there, we wouldn't
look any bigger than grains of sand.

38
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:08,073
I never... I never knew who my father was.

39
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,993
And my mother, she died a long time ago.

40
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,071
Mukuro killed her.

41
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,582
I want to escape from this place.

42
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,506
I want out of this hell.

43
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:42,934
The eighth month is fast approaching

44
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:53,780
And yet I've nothing to wear

45
00:06:53,872 --> 00:07:00,084
I want to dress gaily

46
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:09,294
So brother, will you lend me just one sleeve?

47
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,419
Whoa, wait just a damn a minute...!

48
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,891
I wish to dress my children and loved ones

49
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:24,976
In the one kimono that I own

50
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:32,570
As for me, I will wear vines

51
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:41,956
That I plucked deep in the mountains

52
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:56,799
If you're gonna try to start some shit
with me, I'll pay you back with interest!

53
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,928
How about it? Why not team up with me?

54
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,182
Say what?

55
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,140
You and me, we're two of a kind.

56
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:10,480
Both of us are loved by this hell we live in.

57
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,235
I don't work with anybody.

58
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:19,906
The light of the full moon shines down

59
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,422
Illuminating the world with its divine light

60
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:39,634
When my lover sneaks in to visit me

61
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:47,942
I wish that the clouds would
hide that light just a little

62
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,405
What're you afraid of?

63
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,452
I ain't afraid of nothin'.

64
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,247
Then why won't you team up with me?

65
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,871
Because I hate your freakin' guts, that's why.

66
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:12,128
Listen, the three of us were
born and raised in this hellhole.

67
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,756
We're at the bottom,
so we can't fall any lower than this.

68
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,590
We don't have anything else to lose.

69
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,266
Isn't that right?

70
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,184
Come with me.

71
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,895
That's one of Satsuma's ships.
It's carrying raw sugar.

72
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,105
We're gonna steal that ship.

73
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,943
We'll steal it and its cargo,
and we'll get off this island.

74
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,255
Change in plans! Let's get out of here!

75
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,583
But what about Mugen?!

76
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,324
Do you have any last words?

77
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,746
Hurry up and get it over with.

78
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,211
Going to Hell don't bother me none.

79
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,585
Life here is pretty much a living Hell, anyway.

80
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:39,136
But the thought of bein' killed by
you bastards rubs me the wrong way.

81
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,214
I lived my life without any help from anybody.

82
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,347
And if I'm gonna die, I'm gonna send
myself to Hell without any help from you.

83
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,904
Son of a...! Shoot! Shoot him!

84
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,849
The same thing happened back then, too.

85
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,062
Mugen was executed by
the Satsuma domain officials

86
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,941
for the assault on the raw sugar transport.

87
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:43,992
But that was a trap set for him by Mukuro.

88
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,945
And so was this time...

89
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,534
Mugen's been killed by him
twice now. I want to avenge him.

90
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,747
Please, kill Mukuro.

91
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,832
I take it you know where he is?

92
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,727
Mugen...

93
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,065
T-There's a--

94
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,152
--What's wrong?
--A-A dead body!

95
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,242
Mugen!

96
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,290
Mugen... You can't be...

97
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,002
Why?

98
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,175
Why'd you have to die?

99
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,135
No way, he's still alive?

100
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,475
Mugen...!

101
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,481
Hey! Mugen!

102
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,426
Got it? You and me are the only ones
who know where this hiding place is.

103
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,628
We'll leave the gold here
until the heat dies down.

104
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,215
--What about Koza?
--I didn't tell her, either.

105
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,680
I'm trusting you on this. Don't go blabbing
to Koza just because you have a thing for her.

106
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,982
Sounds like you think it was
Koza that won me over.

107
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,775
What, it wasn't?

108
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,481
The reason I signed on was for the money.

109
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:49,659
So all my little plots were for nothing, huh?

110
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,954
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

111
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,347
Hey, you people there.

112
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,549
May we help you?

113
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,511
You know that a government transport ship
was attacked here last night, right?

114
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,516
Yes.

115
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:22,021
We're looking for leads on the attackers.
Did you see or hear anything?

116
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,978
Those are strange clothes.
Are you from this village?

117
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,904
Get over here! We found the ship!

118
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,655
What?!

119
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,627
Is anybody on board?

120
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,545
Is the money safe?!

121
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,799
The hold is empty!

122
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,471
Where the heck did Jin and Koza go?

123
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,520
Mugen's back, but they aren't here...

124
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,947
What?

125
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,161
I'm starving...

126
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,123
Hang on, I'll go scrounge something up.

127
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,058
Finally here, huh?

128
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,769
Shiren's waiting on pins
and needles for you inside.

129
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,228
You! How did you know about this place?

130
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,104
She wouldn't...

131
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,488
I was supposed to be the one who killed him.

132
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,281
Draw your weapon!

133
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,767
I was such a fool...

134
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:14,481
I was completely fooled...
I was, and so were you...

135
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,092
Mugen? He couldn't have--

136
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:47,021
Where the heck did he go?! Geez!

137
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,695
You're--

138
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,578
What, you thought I was
gonna die before I killed you?

139
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,957
I'm gonna go put an end to this.

140
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,088
I killed him.

141
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,215
What did you say?

142
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,468
Mukuro is dead. I killed him.

143
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,016
You son of a...

144
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,719
--I was gonna...
--I was played.

145
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,937
We were played for fools.

146
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,734
As was he.

147
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,448
This is one opponent
that I will be unable to kill.

148
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,637
Do you think we did the right thing?

149
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:14,817
Of course we did. You wanted
to be free of Mukuro, didn't you?

150
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,522
And now we have money to burn.

151
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:22,029
Once the heat dies down,
I'll show you where it's hidden.

152
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,029
You're having second thoughts?

153
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,910
There's no other way for me to get by in life.

154
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,713
My whole life, this is how I've had to live.

155
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,927
Don't abandon me, okay? Don't leave me.

156
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,022
Kill me...

157
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,485
Please, kill me!

158
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:39,037
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

159
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,124
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

160
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:51,349
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

161
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,929
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

162
00:21:56,065 --> 00:22:00,980
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

163
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:06,231
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

164
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:11,410
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

165
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:16,078
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

166
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:22,331
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

167
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:27,256
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

168
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:32,386
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

169
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:37,311
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

170
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:42,604
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

171
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:47,947
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

172
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:53,027
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

173
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:57,748
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

174
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:02,078
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

175
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:06,131
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

176
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:14,304
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

177
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:20,138
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
