1
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,592
Vagrant Mugen.

2
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,520
And vagrant ronin Jin.

3
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,690
The aforementioned two parties will
hereby be executed by beheading,

4
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,483
and their heads put on display!.

5
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,654
Well? Feeling any regret?

6
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:59,529
Do you feel like throwing yourselves at
my feet and begging for forgiveness now?

7
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,659
If living means bowing down
to the likes of you bastards...

8
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,866
...then I'll die on my feet
with my head held high!

9
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,833
That was well said. I'm with him.

10
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,664
Very well, then.

11
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,548
As you wish, I'll send you
straight to the afterlife!

12
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,610
"Tempestuous Temperaments
(Sturm und Drang)"

13
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:43,701
Hey, aren't my dumplings ready yet?

14
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,325
Yes, sir! Coming right up!

15
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,907
Hey, baby, let's have some fun!

16
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,118
C'mon, don't give me that frown...

17
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,875
--No way!
--Sorry for the wait!

18
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,297
What kept you, idiot?

19
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,670
I-I'm sorry...

20
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,843
--Where are my dumplings?!
--Coming!

21
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,717
Man, this place is boring...

22
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:03,718
It sure is.

23
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,642
Isn't there anything fun to do around here?

24
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,515
Geez, what's the deal with
these customers today?

25
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,063
Now, now, Fuu, ijust bear with it.

26
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,265
But they--

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,818
That blonde boy is the son
of the prefectural governor.

28
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,486
Check it out, it's brand new!

29
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,779
Hey, nice!

30
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,324
I kinda want to do a test cut with it.

31
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,868
What're you lookin' at?

32
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,662
Hey! I'm talkin' to you, old man!

33
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,699
Ouch! Hot!

34
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,750
That got him!

35
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,464
Hey, you people!

36
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,671
G-Governor, I beg of you!

37
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:48,509
If I lose this construction ijob,
my whole family will have to commit suicide!

38
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,594
Please, sir!. Please!.

39
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:06,451
What's this supposed to be?

40
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,620
Um, well...

41
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,039
This chicken feed isn't money!

42
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:17,329
Hey! Go and get rid of that insolent peasant.

43
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:23,051
Don't. You might not want
to hear it, but ijust let it go.

44
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,845
See those bodyguards of the governor's?

45
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:32,553
They're famous even in Edo as being
top-class fighters, even among the Yagyu.

46
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,640
Even if those samurai over there worked
together, they couldn't take them down.

47
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
Understand?

48
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,195
Welcome!

49
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,369
Water.

50
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,670
Water?

51
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,713
Yeah, water.

52
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:05,215
Um, I'm sorry, but we don't serve
customers who only order water.

53
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,717
If you've got no money, try somewhere else--

54
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,102
50 dumplings. How about it?

55
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,853
Let's make a deal. I'll take
care of those guys for you.

56
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,809
--But...
--What?

57
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,314
Maybe for 20...

58
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,272
Are you kidding me? I won't go a dumpling lower.

59
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,653
Hey, where's my tea?!

60
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,405
Yes, sir, coming right up!

61
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,455
What was that for?

62
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,457
I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

63
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,006
I don't wanna hear it.
How are you gonna make up for this?

64
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,082
Um...

65
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,294
Well, maybe I'll take a finger for my trouble.

66
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,889
--C'mon, hold still...
--H-Hey, what're you doing? Cut it out!

67
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,265
Master, let me do it.

68
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,973
I was hoping to give this a test cut anyway.

69
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,683
S-Somebody...

70
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,144
Help me...

71
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,573
Don't make a fuss.
You'll lose more than a finger.

72
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,198
Well, now, what'll it be?

73
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,578
Your nose, maybe? An ear? Or maybe even your...

74
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,378
That money should be enough for you.

75
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:31,634
Like they say, it costs six mon to
cross the Sanzu, the river of the dead.

76
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,932
Damn it...

77
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,510
Move it. You're blocking the road.

78
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,563
Who the hell are you?

79
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,062
Are you trying to interfere?

80
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:47,487
To serve your lord and do
his bidding... Is that honor?

81
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,235
Of course it is.

82
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,659
Even if that lord is a piece-of-shit nobody?

83
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,534
--What did you say?!
--Hey, watch that tongue of yours!

84
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,741
Cutting down a man who's done nothing wrong...

85
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:03,044
Is that what you spent all those
years honing your skills for?

86
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,543
Why, you little...

87
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,842
To be blunt, I think you're worthless.

88
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,466
--We don't have to answer to you!
--Say your prayers!

89
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,805
A hundred dumplings!

90
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,099
Geez, your lives ain't worth squat.

91
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,400
Say what?

92
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,978
That's the price I'm getting for your lives.

93
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,065
What's that work out to, five dumplings a pop?

94
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,859
The numbers don't add up...

95
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:38,573
Are you trying to make me mad, buddy?
You sure got some balls.

96
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,455
Maybe I'll break in my sword on you!

97
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,285
Let's see you try.

98
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:58,050
I won't give you any of that crap
about attacking me one at a time.

99
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,975
Come at me all at once!

100
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,679
--You son of a...
--Don't screw with us!

101
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,400
C'mon!

102
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,248
Oh, crap!

103
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,914
Hey, what's the matter?

104
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,625
What are you, some kinda moron?

105
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,681
You don't get it. You ijust
don't get it, do you, buddy?

106
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,258
My old man's the governor around here.

107
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,561
Folks who lay a finger on me pay the price.

108
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:47,482
Hell, I guess they don't live
to see the next sunrise.

109
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,605
Get it now?

110
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,982
That's right, this ain't the
damn warring states period.

111
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:56,783
Folks who swing swords around in this
day and age are nothing but anachronistic--

112
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,699
Do you understand what I ijust said?

113
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,953
Not a word.

114
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:09,163
You've got to! It's common sense around here!

115
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,966
Your common sense don't mean jack to me.

116
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,544
I hail from the Ryukyu islands.

117
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,690
W-Wait, wait, wait! Wait just a minute!

118
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,689
Do you want money?
I'll give you as much as you want!

119
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,736
So ijust wait! Okay?

120
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,233
You...

121
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,909
I'll keep these.

122
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,613
S-Some...

123
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,620
Somebody! Somebody seize that man!

124
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,370
You bunch of cowards!

125
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:58,345
Listen, my old man's got three Yagyu
badasses on his payroll right now.

126
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,516
What's the matter? You scared?

127
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,685
You feel sorry now?

128
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,559
--I'm sorry!
--Hey, gimme your hand.

129
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,110
All right, listen up!
You guys ain't worth my time.

130
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,740
You have until the count of ten
to go bring those badasses here!

131
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,538
I'll be waiting right here,
counting on his fingers.

132
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,240
Here's one...

133
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,087
And two...

134
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,418
And three!

135
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,092
And four!

136
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,346
This is boring...
What the hell, let's do 'em all!

137
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,643
W-Wait a minute!

138
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:57,528
Y-You wouldn't happen to be one of
the Yagyu swordsmen, would you...?

139
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,981
I see you're in the middle of something.
Pardon the interruption.

140
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,532
Are you one?

141
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,905
One of those so-called badasses?

142
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,750
You've got the wrong man.

143
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,128
If it's the Yagyus you want,
they died ijust recently.

144
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,550
They're dead?

145
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,252
I was the one who killed them.

146
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,008
All the better!

147
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,709
Mr. Ryuijiro?

148
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,802
Burn...!

149
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,805
Burn to the ground!

150
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,933
Talk about your tailor-made settings...

151
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,016
Aren't you going to run?

152
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,853
Hey, don't put yourself out on my account, ijack.

153
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,074
Crap!

154
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,376
Damn, that's cold!

155
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,919
Huh?

156
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,717
What the hell? What's going on?

157
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,599
Don't you remember?

158
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,354
That was a dream, right? There was a fire, and--

159
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,559
That was no dream.

160
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,522
Oh, right. And you were there in a
bathtub with your dong hanging out...

161
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,026
That was a dream.

162
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,780
I only wish it were a dream.

163
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,159
My son ended up burning to death in that fire.

164
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,787
I have to pay you back in full for that.

165
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:20,292
As luck would have it, this place used to
be called the torture department store.

166
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:24,422
I'm gonna take real good care of you
until your execution tomorrow.

167
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,234
Fuu.

168
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,657
This is bad news for you, too, isn't it?

169
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,655
No, it's no big deal.

170
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,864
You don't have any relatives,
so if you like, why don't you come with us?

171
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,952
No, that's okay. This helped me make up my mind.

172
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,883
I swear, you're the lowest of the low...

173
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,631
Say what?

174
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,260
Your stance leaves you wide open,
and your movements are completely inefficient.

175
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,808
Everything about the way
you fight is a total mess.

176
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,681
You son of a...

177
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:23,109
I swear, I've never fought
anyone as wild as you.

178
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,811
Are you trying to piss me off...?

179
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,943
You're also the first person
I wasn't able to kill.

180
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:33,119
The name's Mugen. Remember it.

181
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,492
--Mugen.
--Yeah.

182
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,167
My name is Jin. You'd do well to remember it.

183
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,208
Please!

184
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,507
Forget it. No one's allowed
to see the prisoners.

185
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,380
Could you bend the rules for me?

186
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,258
Just for a minute. A few seconds, even.

187
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,305
--Pretty please!
--Forget it!

188
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,600
I'm begging you! I'll do anything!

189
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,642
Anything?

190
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,095
You will?

191
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,896
Then how about some se--

192
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,644
Not that.

193
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,694
What the hell?! You said you'd
do anything, you little bitch!

194
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,567
What's your problem, you bald old fart?!

195
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,276
I'm not bald! This is a hairstyle!

196
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,243
Thanks for the help, Momo!

197
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:29,713
Oh, wow... They really put you
through the wringer, didn't they?

198
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,884
Hey, you're...

199
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,634
...that girl from the teahouse.

200
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,636
Do you want to know why I'm here?

201
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,469
--Not really.
--Oh, really? Goodbye, then.

202
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm kidding! Hold up!

203
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:47,652
Listen, if you promise you'll do something
for me, I'll help you get out of here.

204
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,898
Are you serious?

205
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,946
--And?
--I'm sorry, sir.

206
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,569
I'm sure she said something
about seeing the prisoners--

207
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,197
--Find her!
--Yes, sir!

208
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,825
Huh? It's not turning...

209
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,657
So, what's this promise you want us to make?

210
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,709
There's a samurai who smells of sunflowers.
I want you to find him for me.

211
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,289
Sunflowers?

212
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,590
--Find her?
--Is she over there?

213
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,133
Hurry.

214
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,094
What happened?

215
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,672
It broke off.

216
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,006
I found her!

217
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,057
--Oh, crap!
--Hold it!

218
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:26,350
Why the hell did she even bother coming here...?

219
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,524
What's it say, what's it say?

220
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,398
Public execution?

221
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,946
At sunset today, it says!

222
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,240
What am I gonna do?

223
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,002
What're you talking about?
I can't sell this stuff to amateurs!

224
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,303
All right, damn it! You know I'm an Edo-ite!

225
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,929
Take 'em and go, you little thief!

226
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,885
Really?!

227
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,187
Thank you so much!

228
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,527
I'm gonna borrow this for a minute, mister!

229
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,154
Hey!

230
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,862
Have you made your peace?

231
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:25,667
Hell, every time the sun
comes up, I think to myself...

232
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:30,122
" Is today gonna be the last
time I'll ever lie in the sun?"

233
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:34,255
Vagrant Mugen! And vagrant ronin Jin!

234
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,256
The aforementioned two parties will
hereby be executed by beheading,

235
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,588
and their heads put on display!

236
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,550
Well? Feeling any regret?

237
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,057
Do you feel like throwing yourselves at
my feet and begging for forgiveness now?

238
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:49,231
If living means bowing down
to the likes of you bastards...

239
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,355
...then I'll die on my feet
with my head held high!

240
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,199
That was well said. I'm with him.

241
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,947
Very well, then.

242
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,404
As you wish, I'll send you
straight to the afterlife!

243
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,916
What the--?

244
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:22,428
Hey. I'll put our fight on hold
until we get outta here.

245
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,100
You intend to kill all these men?

246
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,975
I swear, you really are the lowest of the low...

247
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,772
You two fools!

248
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,567
Don't even think that you'll
make it out of here alive!

249
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,733
--Hey, what's going on?
--What's happening?

250
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,160
Fire! A light! Somebody give me a light!

251
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,112
Here, take this!

252
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,910
Come back here!

253
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,733
Hey, hold it!

254
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,811
Hold it right there...

255
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,273
What are you doing?! Kill them! Kill them both!

256
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,363
W-Wait a minute! Is it money you're after?

257
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,415
I-If you want money,
I'll give you as much as you want!

258
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,493
You'd try the patience of a saint...

259
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,123
...but I'm no saint!

260
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,714
Crap, there's no end to these guys...

261
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,887
Hey.

262
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,634
What's she--?

263
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,422
Okay... Now it's your turn.

264
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,544
Right.

265
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,591
Hey, wait a minute!

266
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,548
Hey, you two haven't forgotten
your promise to me, have you?!

267
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,758
There's something that I have to see to first.

268
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,469
Yeah, lemme kill this bastard first.

269
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,807
Hey, wait a minute! What if you
two end up killing each other?!

270
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,859
Who would go with me then?!

271
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,608
All right, then.

272
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,740
Toss this coin, and if it comes up heads,
hack away all you want.

273
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,540
But if it comes up tails,
both of you will stay with me.

274
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,706
Are we clear?

275
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,330
Gimme that.

276
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,676
Don't you think you tossed it a bit too far?

277
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,220
The man doesn't know the meaning of restraint.

278
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,296
Kiss my ass.

279
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,634
I mean, it's taking forever to come down!

280
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,391
Ouch!

281
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,891
There they are! Hold it!

282
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,725
You're under arrest!

283
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,856
Crap!

284
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,279
It's tails! I win!

285
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:50,386
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

286
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:55,638
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

287
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:00,816
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

288
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:05,484
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

289
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:11,782
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

290
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:16,704
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

291
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:21,788
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

292
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:26,717
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

293
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:32,011
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

294
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:37,353
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

295
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:42,433
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

296
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,155
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

297
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:51,530
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

298
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,579
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

299
00:22:55,708 --> 00:23:03,706
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

300
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:12,047
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
