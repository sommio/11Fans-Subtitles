1
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,709
Thank you, come again!

2
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,933
And who might you be?

3
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:53,944
You know that I'm Munetada Tajima
of the Fu'un Sekisai school, don't you?

4
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,944
Of course. That's why I chose you.

5
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:03,662
All right, then. I'll take you on
for a little after-dinner exercise.

6
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,285
Come on!

7
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,511
" Lethal Lunacy (Fight Fire with Fire)"

8
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,893
Geez, I'm so hungry...

9
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,349
I'm sick and tired of hearing you say that.

10
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,938
Come on, we haven't had anything
to eat since the checkpoint...

11
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,523
Then go drink from the river or something.

12
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,450
Sorry, friend, but we don't
even have money for lodgings.

13
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,705
We don't have anything to give you as alms.

14
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,415
I'm glad to hear you say that.

15
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:08,386
You came at a perfect time. We've been
in a bind because we're so short on help.

16
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,600
Once you're finished wiping down
the floors, please polish the Buddha.

17
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,355
All right?

18
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,936
You bald bastard, who do you
think we are, your slaves?!

19
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,271
Hey, quit your complaining!

20
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,359
He's feeding us and letting
us stay here for free!

21
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,947
That reminds me. Don't forget to chop
firewood and mend the sliding doors.

22
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,532
Screw you!

23
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,342
Oh, geez...

24
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:44,513
Damn it, I'm always the one who
has to clean up their messes!

25
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:48,179
" Rest Stop "

26
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:48,470
Talk about scary...

27
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,349
--What happened?
--What, haven't you heard?

28
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,560
It's another street killing.
This is the third one this month.

29
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,111
And the only people that the killer
goes after are skilled samurai.

30
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:04,532
And it says here that they've gotten fed up
and put a ten ryo bounty on his head.

31
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,985
No way! Ten ryo?!

32
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,289
Hey, are you listening to me?

33
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,116
A ten ryo bounty! Ten ryo!

34
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,544
That much money would get us
to Nagasaki with no problem.

35
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,373
A street killer, huh? I can't
really say that I'm interested.

36
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,174
Is this guy a real badass?

37
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,376
He has to be.

38
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,840
I mean, he's specifically targeting
and killing skilled samurai.

39
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,548
Okay, then.

40
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,429
Well, I'm going out for a bit.

41
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,683
Hey, wait!

42
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,186
Jin, see to the rest of the chores here, okay?

43
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,937
Hey!

44
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,564
Good grief...

45
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:46,526
--Well?
--Come on, little lady. Think it through.

46
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,579
If you see the street killer,
it means that he sees you, too.

47
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,156
Once that happens, you're as good as dead.

48
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,459
Oh, right... I wonder if there
are some clues or something.

49
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:01,461
Hey. Who's the best swordsman around here?

50
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,167
What the heck are you asking him that for?

51
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,844
The killer's gonna go after him next, right?

52
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:07,921
Oh...

53
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,428
Well? Hello?

54
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,384
Seishiro Momoi.

55
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,015
Thanks, mister.

56
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,486
--Hey, what are you doing?
--Oh, don't mind me.

57
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,781
--What is it?
--You're that samurai named Momoi, ain't ya?

58
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,986
Indeed. This is Master Seishiro Momoi,
instructor at the Gensou Academy,

59
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,821
also known as the Human Dynamo.

60
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,952
You want to be my disciple?

61
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,409
Glad to hear it. Now the street killer will--

62
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,711
Are you the street killer?!

63
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,005
You've got guts, showing
your face in broad daylight!

64
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,629
--Huh? You're making a mistake!
--Say your prayers!

65
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,260
I said you were making a mistake, didn't I?!

66
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,512
P-Please, wait! It was all a lie!

67
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,391
The whole Human Dynamo thing
was a lie that I spread myself!

68
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,474
S-Spare me!

69
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,150
This guy is useless.

70
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,731
Yes, I saw one of the corpses.

71
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,409
--Really?
--It was the strangest thing I ever saw.

72
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,451
There wasn't a single sword cut on it,

73
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:19,536
but blood was spurting out of his eyes,
ears, and every other orifice when he died.

74
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,540
How was he killed, then?

75
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,212
I have no idea.

76
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,259
If the authorities could figure that out,
he would've been arrested long ago.

77
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,469
What's the big idea?!

78
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,674
Hey, there's no need to shout.

79
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,260
I'm sure this nice gentleman
didn't bump into me on purpose.

80
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:41,473
I'm sure my friends would be willing
to overlook this unfortunate incident,

81
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,685
if you give us a little
something as an apology.

82
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,565
C'mon, say something!

83
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,569
You wanna end up as food
for the ravens, buddy?

84
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,573
I have no interest in the likes of you.

85
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,122
What I'm saying is,
I'm not interested in weaklings.

86
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,793
--Why, you...
--Who the hell do you think
you are, you bastard?!

87
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,047
Shit!

88
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,339
Monster! That guy's a monster!

89
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,307
That's enough for today, I think.

90
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,063
I'll finish this last log, then.

91
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,736
I'll go get dinner ready.

92
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,322
What a lively piece of firewood!

93
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:39,326
Perhaps I'll use this as
kindling for today's bath.

94
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,374
What'll it be?

95
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,503
Sake.

96
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,928
That won't buy you much,
but maybe that's for the best.

97
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,346
What's that mean?

98
00:07:55,433 --> 00:08:00,018
Haven't you heard? These parts
have been dangerous lately.

99
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,185
That street killer, you mean?

100
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,935
Yeah, business here has
been lousy because of him.

101
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,479
Hit me again.

102
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,858
Sorry, mister, but that's all
that 1 0 mon will buy you.

103
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,439
Excuse me.

104
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,070
Help yourself to mine.

105
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,997
When they speak of the joy of sake,
that is only when you are slightly tipsy.

106
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,450
I've had a little too much to drink tonight.

107
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:27,208
--Be my guest.
--Sure, if you insist.

108
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,548
Oops. My apologies.

109
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,377
It looks like I really have had
too much to drink tonight.

110
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,348
How about you? You know anything, buddy?

111
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,519
--About what?
--The street killer.

112
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,564
I have no idea. I'm rather
out of touch with public affairs.

113
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:51,486
Word has it that he only goes after
tough people. Why do you think that is?

114
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,360
I don't know. I couldn't really say.

115
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:58,535
But I once heard a story
that goes something like this...

116
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,785
Long ago on the mainland, there
was a mountain-climbing expert.

117
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,619
This man had climbed
an amazingly tall mountain.

118
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,420
But no one had ever seen this mountain,

119
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,045
so they couldn't comprehend the
magnitude of this accomplishment.

120
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:17,800
Reluctantly, the man continued to climb
mountains that were said to be even taller.

121
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:23,807
Day after day he climbed, all in order to
make the people recognize his greatness.

122
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:30,518
In the end, the man made the mountains
his home and he became a demon.

123
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,728
And?

124
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,528
The story ends there.

125
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,607
I don't get the point.

126
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,613
Forgive me, I suppose there
was no point to the story.

127
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,365
Well, this is where we go our separate ways.

128
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,822
Watch out for that street killer.

129
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,033
Thank you. You, too.

130
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,035
You're him, ain't ya?

131
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,461
What the hell kinda fighting stance is that?

132
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,267
Impressive, you dodged it...

133
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,604
This should be entertaining.

134
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,445
There he is! It's the killer!

135
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,790
The night of the next full moon.
Let us meet here again.

136
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,755
What the hell...?

137
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,230
What a beautiful moon.
I love watching it from here.

138
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,693
Oh, there you are!

139
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,565
I'm sorry!

140
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,567
That's all right, miss.

141
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,025
Um, about that street killer...

142
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,237
They say that the corpses
were bleeding from everywhere,

143
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,619
even though there wasn't a cut on them.

144
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,873
Listen, don't you think this is too dangerous?

145
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,336
Jin! What the heck do you think you're doing?!

146
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,716
My apologies.

147
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,516
But the speed of your movements makes
me think that you're no ordinary priest.

148
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,185
What do you mean, not an ordinary priest?

149
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,439
Hey.

150
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,233
Mugen! When did you get back?

151
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,188
Hey, your hand...

152
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,149
--How did they get cut up like this?
--It's nothing.

153
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,574
I wouldn't call those nothing!

154
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,323
You ran into the street killer, didn't you?

155
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,700
--Yeah.
--No way...

156
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:54,286
The guy had this weird-ass sword. It was like
a powerful wind shot out of it or something.

157
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,211
--A wind?
--Yeah.

158
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,005
And when it hit me, it...

159
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,753
I knew it.

160
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:04,429
The street killer is most
likely a man called Shoryu.

161
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,426
What, you know the guy?

162
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,179
He was once a pupil of mine.

163
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:18,561
At one time, I was a warrior
who had his own dojo.

164
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:27,245
Shoryu-- No, at the time, his name was Ukon--
was a student at my dojo back then.

165
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,446
He was a man of considerable skill,

166
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,831
and he devoted himself heart and soul to the
martial arts, spending each day in their study.

167
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:41,508
Eventually, Ukon was sent on a sea voyage
on the orders of this domain's lord,

168
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,459
but the ship met with disaster.

169
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:48,423
It was believed that the ship
had gone down with all hands.

170
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:59,818
But Ukon miraculously washed ashore
on the continent, and escaped death.

171
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:09,028
In that land, he apparently
encountered a strange martial art.

172
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:19,709
Who could have known how great
an impact that would have on him...?

173
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,088
Ten years after he had disappeared,

174
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:34,678
he returned to these lands after crossing
the sea, determined to make it or die trying.

175
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:40,563
But he had changed so completely that
he almost seemed a different person.

176
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,397
Learning the martial arts of the
continent has made me realize

177
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,700
how weak and empty those that
I had previously studied were.

178
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,197
There is a technique called Hakkei.

179
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:59,332
It allows you to defeat an opponent, not with
strength, but with the power of your inner chi.

180
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,916
After arduous training,
I mastered this technique.

181
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,595
But what of the warriors of this
country? What have they done?

182
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,423
I wish to teach the ways
of the true martial arts

183
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,556
to the samurai who have grown indolent
and weak in this peaceful country.

184
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,012
I want to do something
about this corrupt country.

185
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:22,066
--Ukon, what are you...
--I have given up that name.

186
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,144
I am now called Shoryu.

187
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,948
I yield!

188
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,698
--Hey, wait!
--Stop! What're you doing?!

189
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,495
What's going on in here?

190
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,913
H-He's dead!

191
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,536
What have you done?

192
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,209
What kind of man kills during training...?

193
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:45,461
You attack a helpless man,
and then go on to kill him...

194
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,167
What do you think the martial arts are for?!

195
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,504
Once mastered, the martial arts
are a tool for killing.

196
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:56,389
In other words, they are to utterly and
completely take the life of your opponent.

197
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,522
I hereby expel you from this dojo.

198
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,648
I-I'm what? Expelled? You're throwing me out?

199
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,818
But why?

200
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,989
I'm expelling you because
you don't understand why.

201
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:14,319
Impossible... You're throwing me out?!

202
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,995
You can't be serious!

203
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,790
You're scared of being beaten by me, is that it?

204
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,792
Is that why you're throwing me out?

205
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,044
You coward!

206
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,482
After Shoryu left my dojo,
he wandered from domain to domain,

207
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,605
trying to be accepted into service.

208
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,689
But I've heard that he was treated
as a heretic no matter where he went,

209
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,492
and no domain would take him in.

210
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,537
After that, they say he
began to hate this world

211
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,909
that wouldn't give him
recognition or even accept him,

212
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,209
and he began to go from dojo to dojo,
killing the master of each one.

213
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,877
As for me, in repentance for being
unable to save the soul of my pupil,

214
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,054
which had become tainted with darkness,

215
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,178
I became the priest that you see before you.

216
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,814
I mustn't allow Shoryu to commit any more sins.

217
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,439
But he is now virtually invincible.

218
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,441
I doubt that there is anyone
who is capable of stopping him.

219
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,113
I'm happy to hear that.

220
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,409
I'm glad I'm gonna have the
chance to take on a guy like that.

221
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,671
What's gotten into you?

222
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,849
Why the sudden change in heart?

223
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,466
Ow!

224
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,809
I've never seen Mugen like this before.

225
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,232
It means that this is one opponent
that he isn't sure he can defeat.

226
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,776
Yep, you gotta meditate under a waterfall...

227
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,121
Screw that.

228
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,751
It isn't a sword that
Shoryu kills with, it is his chi.

229
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,625
In this country, the technique is
sometimes called the Armor Piercer.

230
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,753
Once mastered, it can destroy
the body's internal organs

231
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,551
without so much as
scratching the opponent's armor.

232
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:22,223
Maybe that's true, but it can't
hurt ya if it don't hit ya, right?

233
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,812
The moon's so big...

234
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,813
Well, I'm heading out for a bit.

235
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,692
Hey, you haven't forgotten, have you?

236
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:44,154
You're gonna help me look for the
samurai who smells of sunflowers, right?

237
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,829
Yeah, I know.

238
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,328
Don't forget.

239
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,535
I will be the one who kills you.

240
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,378
Who do you think you are, my wife or something?

241
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:18,191
I knew you would come. You don't
know how happy this makes me.

242
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:23,197
Ever since I returned from the
continent, everyone has feared me.

243
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,451
It never even occurred to them
to recognize my strength.

244
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:34,162
In spite of the fact that my skills were far
superior to those that the people call masters.

245
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,417
And so, I taught them a lesson.

246
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,422
I showed them who was really the strongest.

247
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,927
Spare me the introductions.
Let's get this started.

248
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,678
As you wish.

249
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,152
Son of a...

250
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,981
You exceeded my expectations.

251
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,996
Why do you fight me?

252
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,377
Is it because I have a bounty on my head?

253
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,881
I don't give a damn about the bounty anymore!

254
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,224
I'm having the time of my life right now!

255
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,720
As am I...

256
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,396
But I think it's about time
that I put an end to this.

257
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,363
I-Impossible...

258
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,035
This can't be!

259
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,782
This time you're mine...!

260
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,987
Ukon...

261
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,454
