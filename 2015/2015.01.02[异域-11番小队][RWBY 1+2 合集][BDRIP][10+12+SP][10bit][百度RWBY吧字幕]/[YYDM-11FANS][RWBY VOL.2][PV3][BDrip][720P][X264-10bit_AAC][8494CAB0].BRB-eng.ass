Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.14,0:00:23.86,D,,0000,0000,0000,,A ravenous, destructive force that covers the majority of Remnant
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.56,0:00:29.04,D,,0000,0000,0000,,While often referred to simply as "Grimm" in the common vernacular
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.04,0:00:33.08,D,,0000,0000,0000,,These being serve as the greatest foe to mankind
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.44,0:00:37.48,D,,0000,0000,0000,,For as long as humanity can recall walking the surface of Remnant
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.48,0:00:41.06,D,,0000,0000,0000,,so do they remember this wicked force
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.00,0:00:50.02,D,,0000,0000,0000,,Many ancient cultures believed the creatures of Grimm to be animals possessed by evil spirits
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.02,0:00:53.80,D,,0000,0000,0000,,or perhaps the spirits of tortured animals themselves
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.80,0:01:00.04,D,,0000,0000,0000,,However further study as well as the discovery of newer, more horrific forms of Grimm
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.04,0:01:02.68,D,,0000,0000,0000,,Does not support this hypothesis
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.30,0:01:05.96,D,,0000,0000,0000,,With new creatures discovered every day
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.96,0:01:11.18,D,,0000,0000,0000,,Scientists perpetually find themselves with more questions than answers
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.80,0:01:17.18,D,,0000,0000,0000,,While very little is know of their origin, some key facts have been observed in the wild
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.18,0:01:22.68,D,,0000,0000,0000,,First and foremost, the Grimm exclusively attack humans and their creations
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.68,0:01:26.94,D,,0000,0000,0000,,While occasional skirmishes between wildlife and Grimm have occurred
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.94,0:01:33.32,D,,0000,0000,0000,,these instances seem to be based on territorial provocations rather than a need for sustenance
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.00,0:01:40.32,D,,0000,0000,0000,,In fact, the common belief is that the Grimm are not obligated to feed
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.08,0:01:42.77,D,,0000,0000,0000,,They choose to
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.34,0:01:48.16,D,,0000,0000,0000,,What is perhaps even more unsettling is the basis of their attraction
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.16,0:01:51.78,D,,0000,0000,0000,,The creatures of Grimm are lured towards negative emotion
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.04,0:01:59.12,D,,0000,0000,0000,,In the rare instances where villages are capable of defending against a wave of Grimm
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.12,0:02:01.56,D,,0000,0000,0000,,Their survival is not guaranteed
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.56,0:02:06.54,D,,0000,0000,0000,,as widespread panic will only lead to more attacks
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.54,0:02:09.68,D,,0000,0000,0000,,Little else is known about the Creatures of Grimm
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.68,0:02:14.18,D,,0000,0000,0000,,Keeping them in captivity has proved to be an understandably difficult task
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.18,0:02:19.58,D,,0000,0000,0000,,as the creatures tend to either die, or kill those who imprisoned them in the first place
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.26,0:02:22.30,D,,0000,0000,0000,,To further complicate study
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.30,0:02:28.82,D,,0000,0000,0000,,The corpse of a Grimm will only remain for a short period of time before completely evaporating
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.82,0:02:33.72,D,,0000,0000,0000,,Those who hunt the beats for sport find this particularly upsetting
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.72,0:02:42.16,D,,0000,0000,0000,,But manage to get by with cheap taxidermic recreations and..bombastic storytelling
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.16,0:02:45.18,D,,0000,0000,0000,,Although the Creatures of Grimm appear mindless
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.18,0:02:48.62,D,,0000,0000,0000,,more delicate observation has proven contradictory
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.52,0:02:53.74,D,,0000,0000,0000,,It has been noted that while younger Grimm tend to be more reckless
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.74,0:02:57.22,D,,0000,0000,0000,,Older Grimm, who have managed to survive their battles
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.22,0:03:02.28,D,,0000,0000,0000,,have the tendency to learn from their experience and will exercise caution in the future
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.28,0:03:08.58,D,,0000,0000,0000,,This perverse form of self-preservation allows the creatures to become more effective killers
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.86,0:03:11.86,D,,0000,0000,0000,,And in the end..
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.86,0:03:16.96,D,,0000,0000,0000,,Killing is all that matters
