1
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:42,509
Many Japanese players are active in
the American Major Leagues today.

2
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,437
However, few are aware of the following episode,

3
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:51,313
which ocurred in Japan during
the early days of baseball.

4
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:59,567
This is a story of men whose souls
burned with a passion for baseball.

5
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:04,659
" Baseball Blues (For Love of a Ball) "

6
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,576
My original reason for visiting this place

7
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,162
was to investigate reports of a foreign ship

8
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,420
that had been spotted from
time to time in the area recently.

9
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,755
Oh, and pardon the belated introduction,
but I'm Manzou the Saw,

10
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,092
a secret policeman who was
transferred to the area just recently.

11
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,680
What did you say?!

12
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:33,893
Let's see... How much
farther do you think it is?

13
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,729
We came this way along
the Nagasaki highway, so...

14
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:41,738
We'll reach Saga soon. It won't be
long before we reach Ikitsuki Island.

15
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,534
Here you are.

16
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,913
Huh? Excuse me, we didn't order all this.

17
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,246
Don't worry about it, I ordered for us.

18
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,259
Hey, what're we gonna do about the money?

19
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,631
Don't sweat it.

20
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,838
Do you have a secret stash
you haven't told us about?

21
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,595
I said, don't worry about it!

22
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,926
Delicious.

23
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,056
Hey, don't start without me!

24
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:17,194
Oh, that was so good... How long
has it been since we ate this much?

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,114
Still, are you certain that
you can take care of the bill?

26
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,362
You bet.

27
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,658
He's skipping out on his bill!!

28
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,744
Come back here!

29
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,955
He didn't!

30
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,468
Damn, this guy is fast!

31
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,157
Ow...

32
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,946
Who threw this?!

33
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,200
Hey, there.

34
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,874
It was you, huh?!

35
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,011
You're pretty good.

36
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,885
How 'bout it? Wanna play some ball?

37
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,841
Play ball?

38
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:38,935
Listen, if you play in the game that's
gonna be held tomorrow, I'll pay your bill.

39
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,898
Or would you rather work your butts off
here for a month to pay it off yourselves?

40
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,358
All right, take the heat for what you did.

41
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,195
You guys shoulda made a break for it, too.

42
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,779
What're you talking about?!

43
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,581
A month is a harsh sentence.
Surely your only option is to play.

44
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,286
What the hell is this ball deal about, anyway?

45
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,373
Baseball. It's a sport from across the sea.

46
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:06,713
Basically, I throw this ball, and you try
to hit it with this stick that's called a bat.

47
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,763
What, it's just a stick game?

48
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,560
This is no game. This is a battle
that our country's future is riding on.

49
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:19,267
--Say what?
--Well, it all began about a week ago.

50
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,909
Who's in charge here?

51
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,783
Hey, where can we find the
person in charge around here?

52
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:37,584
I'm the town consul, if that's what you mean.

53
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:44,793
This is Commodore Alexander Joy Cartwright,
commander of the U.S. East Indies Fleet.

54
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,343
I'm Doubleday, his interpreter.

55
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,675
We Americans have come here because
we want to open trade with this country.

56
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,012
Y-You can make all the outrageous
demands you like, but I can't help you.

57
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:03,023
Besides, there is an official edict that all
foreign ships are to be driven off immediately.

58
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,945
Fuck them!

59
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,616
Please don't get the wrong impression here.

60
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:17,325
We didn't come here to make
a request. This is an order.

61
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:22,334
Or would you prefer to go to war against us?

62
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,417
Whoa! Baseball? Sonuvagun!

63
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,095
Baseball, on a little island in the Far East?

64
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:34,971
Incredible! The sport of gentlemen
comes to the country of savages!

65
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,556
All right, you're on.

66
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:47,191
In this peaceful country, there's no need
for either one of us to throw our lives away.

67
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,818
What?

68
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,076
We'll settle this with baseball!

69
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:57,577
And so, that's how we got stuck
playing a game against the Yankees.

70
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:03,537
But why did those Americans come
all this way to do something like that?

71
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,293
What a bunch of troublemakers!

72
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,964
Don't you have any other players?

73
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,260
Well, I did, but...

74
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,636
Listen up! This is gonna be
one seriously tough game!

75
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,469
Get it into your heads that if we don't win,
there will be no tomorrow for us!

76
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,054
Have I made myself clear, you sons of--

77
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,065
Hey!

78
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,144
Look, if it's that tough,
I'd rather not be in it...

79
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,648
Seriously. Leave me out of it.

80
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,482
Um, I have some errands
to run, so see you later!

81
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,031
Get back here, damn it!

82
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,080
So that's how it went, and everybody ran away.

83
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,661
So tell me something.
Are these Yankees really that tough?

84
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,916
You bet.

85
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,044
All right, I'll do it!

86
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,091
Well, give it your best shot.

87
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,343
What're you talking about?
We don't have enough people.

88
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,391
All three of you are gonna play!

89
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,852
So, they came all the way to this
little port to catch us by surprise...

90
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,859
What should we do, sir?
We have to report this to Edo at once.

91
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,239
Hold your horses. Before we do that,
I'm gonna sneak aboard that ship.

92
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,365
But that's... that's too dangerous!

93
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,242
Don't worry about me.

94
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,996
I just need to cleverly disguise myself as
an American, and it'll be a piece of cake.

95
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,623
Okay...

96
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,257
You said your name was Kagemaru, right?

97
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,460
How did you know about this baseball stuff?

98
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:38,549
For generations, we've worked as
secret agents for a certain feudal domain.

99
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,884
No way! You mean you were a ninja?

100
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,019
That's right. Kyushu has always had a
lot of dealings with foreign countries,

101
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:50,068
so we've been researching
those countries for generations.

102
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,692
But then the national isolation
policy went into effect,

103
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,114
and our domain was crushed, too.

104
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,243
And so, they learned the rules
of the game in a single night,

105
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,122
and were given a crash course
in baseball through the night.

106
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:12,082
However, this part is boring,
so I'll skip over it.

107
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,588
Freeze!

108
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,643
Who are you?

109
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,473
Who are you?!

110
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,560
Oh! American! American!

111
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,734
Shut up!

112
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,188
Nooo!

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,907
"Sports Fighting Spirit Period Drama "

114
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,952
"Samurai Champloo "

115
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,243
It's finally beginning!
The matchup of the century is underway!

116
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:51,421
In this battle, the national prestige
of America and Japan is on the line!

117
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,751
My name is Ichiemon, and I will be
acting as your announcer today!

118
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,382
Aren't we a few people short?

119
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,634
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

120
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,556
Hey, look!

121
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,429
They let the dogs play baseball here?

122
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,437
Fantastic! That's the mystical orient for you!

123
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,898
What did you just say?

124
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,781
They're full-fledged players, too.

125
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:23,111
It doesn't say anything in the rules
about animals not being allowed.

126
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,572
Okay!

127
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,407
It's the first at-bat! Play ball!

128
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,835
Doubleday is on the mound, and he lets it rip!

129
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,459
It's a bunt!

130
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,546
No!

131
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,091
Ninja baseball...

132
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,972
The next batter in the lineup is Jin.

133
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,725
Oh, my! He's using a gedan sword stance!

134
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,149
Can he successfully apply
this technique to baseball?!

135
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,603
He nailed it! The ball is
heading for short center field!

136
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,654
That was great!

137
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,572
The next batter up is Mugen, with no
outs and runners on first and second.

138
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,949
And this new batter is using
a two-sword technique!

139
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,576
Come on!

140
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,908
The pitcher winds up for his
first pitch, and... What's this?

141
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,791
They're going to load the bases.
They're intentionally walking him.

142
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,298
No way!

143
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,099
Out!

144
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:35,816
Oh, no! He passed the runner
in front of him! He's out!

145
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,986
No way...

146
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,906
The next batter up is Fuu,
the lone girl on the team.

147
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,281
--Let's do it!
--Strike!

148
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,077
Strike!

149
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,998
Strike three! Batter's out!

150
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,626
Tragically, she was struck out.

151
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,582
The next batter is the village consul,
the oldest on the team at age 80.

152
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,096
Mister!

153
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:14,306
Listen, step over my corpse and
move on to a brighter tomorrow...

154
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,061
Mister!

155
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,982
Now, then, the next batter up is... the dog?

156
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,910
Hey, there's no way that
an animal can hit the ball!

157
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,954
It'll be fine. He won't have to.

158
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,243
Ball! Ball!

159
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,747
Ball!

160
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,251
Oh, my! The pitcher can't seem to
get anything into the strike zone!

161
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,585
Exactly. An animal's strike zone is tiny.

162
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,969
All he has to do is stand there,
and he'll get walked.

163
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,220
And here comes the fourth pitch!

164
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,477
He ran away!

165
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,064
Momo!

166
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,022
Damn, I guess they're just animals, after all.

167
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:11,363
What's this, then? Why's a ball game
being held in secret like this?

168
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,500
Who are you?

169
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,579
I could say that I was just a
baseball fan who was passing by,

170
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,505
but I guess that would be a lie.

171
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,380
We're short on players,
so you're gonna play, too.

172
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,680
A pinch hitter has come in! A perfectly innocent
baseball fan who happened to be passing by!

173
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,056
Oh, my! It's his first at-bat,
and he's calling a home run!

174
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,059
Who is this player?! Where did he come from?!

175
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,056
" Bunt! "

176
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,361
And Doubleday throws the first pitch!

177
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,324
Strike!

178
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,077
That moron...

179
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:53,696
"Wrong! "

180
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,951
" Didn't you understand me?! "

181
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,786
" I said bunt! "

182
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,583
" Bunt! "

183
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,833
Okay, here's the second pitch!

184
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,462
Strike two!

185
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,044
That dumb son of a bitch!

186
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:08,920
" Moron! "

187
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:09,803
" Dumbass! "

188
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:10,721
" Bunt, damn it! "

189
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,260
" Bunt! "

190
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,349
"Or you're dead! "

191
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:22,901
The batter's in a hole! And here
comes the pitcher's third throw!

192
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,362
No!

193
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,908
The Japanese team is playing unexpectedly well!

194
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,915
The American players are
currently gathered on the mound.

195
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,542
Son of a bitch!

196
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,918
Fucking Japs!

197
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,252
Time to teach these savages how we do things.

198
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:54,887
An eye for an eye.
The American way, all the way!

199
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,138
Play...

200
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,561
Ball!

201
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,472
Ball!

202
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,230
Shit! They're playing dirty!

203
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,410
Here it comes!

204
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,249
Amen.

205
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,423
No, I'm still alive...

206
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,924
Manzou is dead, but freedom will never die...!

207
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,055
That was dirty! Umpire!

208
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,062
So, they're in cahoots.

209
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,937
Now, here comes the first pitch to Jin!

210
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,568
Holy cow, he's fast! Will he go
for an in-the-park home run?!

211
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,000
What the--?

212
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,970
I... am ashamed...

213
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,556
Out!

214
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,730
That's three! Change sides!

215
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,074
I want you to stay out of this.

216
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,287
Hey, I ain't dead yet...

217
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:47,671
Nobody else is gonna use that
mound until my arm falls off.

218
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,258
The American team is finally on the offensive,

219
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:58,261
but the opposing Japanese team
only has a pitcher and a first baseman!

220
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,138
What in the world do they hope to do?!

221
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,314
Out!

222
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,191
God damn!

223
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:19,528
Their next batter is Commodore
Alexander Joy Cartwright!

224
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,165
Don't try it! Get out of there!

225
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,289
Come to papa!

226
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,959
I die with no regrets...

227
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,592
Out!

228
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,348
Things have gotten serious!

229
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,896
The Japanese team now has
only one player remaining!

230
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:52,353
How in the world does he intend to keep
fighting when the odds are 1 against 9?!

231
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,731
This is no contest at all!

232
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,403
Against a bunch of pansies like you...

233
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,955
...one of me is plenty!

234
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,665
Mugen is full of spirit as
he winds up his pitch, and--

235
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,001
What in the world is he doing?!

236
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,551
--Shit!
--That's a balk! Balk!

237
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,390
Ball!

238
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,309
Ball! Ball!

239
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,602
Ball four!

240
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,725
His plan has gone to pieces.

241
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:34,152
Not only does the pitcher have no
control, he also seems to be dizzy!

242
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,402
All right, then. I guess I'll throw it normally.

243
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:55,381
N-No human being could
possibly hit a pitch like that...!

244
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,757
Nooo!

245
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,721
D-Dead ball!

246
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,984
God help us... This isn't baseball!

247
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,528
This is madness!

248
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,908
What an amazing turn of events!

249
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,959
The American team's bench is
now piled high with corpses, too!

250
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,083
They are down to one player!

251
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:40,339
This game has become a battle of
one against one! Man against man!

252
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:47,597
I'm not going to lose!
America can't afford to lose!

253
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,283
I can't believe it! Both players are down!

254
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,709
What will become of this game?!

255
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,414
Will it end as a suspended game?

256
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,173
Jesus...

257
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,381
Friggin' kamikaze!

258
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,932
All right, you damn Yankees...

259
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,386
Hurry up and haul your asses
back to your own country!

260
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:38,021
He's on his feet! The American
team has no players left!

261
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:41,946
The game is over! The game is over!

262
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:50,702
"Japan "
"America "

263
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:55,247
and the Americans went home with
a profound fear of Japanese people.

264
00:20:55,337 --> 00:21:04,427
They didn't return to these shores until
the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1 853.

265
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:08,472
One morning, I lay stretched
out in the grass by the river

266
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,599
A butterfly tickles my nose,
and the predawn sky is infinitely far away

267
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,932
What is projected on this gradually darkening
blue screen is the continuation of my dream

268
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:22,487
I yawn and stretch, the character for "big "
standing alone among the sounds of spring

269
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:27,112
Snow lingers on the distant mountaintops
as my path carries me across the seasons

270
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,239
A swallow brushes my cheek as it flies past

271
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,537
And looking back, calls out
"Good morning! " to me

272
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:36,414
It's time to be off, and with a "Heave ho "
I get to my feet, but where am I off to?

273
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,745
As to that, as to that,
as to that, as to that...

274
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,955
Yeah, right now, it's early spring,
and my journey has just begun

275
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,669
In other words, we travel westwards,
wandering hoodlums who think we 're samurai

276
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:50,223
The souls accompanying us drift up to the sky
If they flap their wings, they can fly

277
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,928
In other words, we travel westwards,
wandering hoodlums who think we 're samurai

278
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:59,436
The souls accompanying us drift up to the sky
If they flap their wings, they can fly

279
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:04,146
I knew from the day I was born that
I would set out on a journey one day

280
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,779
With a knapsack on my tiny back,
I heard a voice calling out behind me

281
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,780
As I walked home from school along
the little path lit by the setting sun

282
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,408
I was overwhelmed each day
at how familiar it seemed

283
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:18,084
The journey finally begins to seek out and
awaken the me that I'm sure lived long ago

284
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,504
Your world is far bigger than what
you read about in the history books

285
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,877
That sensation reverberating up
from beneath your sneakers

286
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,051
Is the history lying beneath the asphalt

287
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:31,130
As I travel from the present
to the past, will I meet myself?

288
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:36,265
Also, my future self will find me,
so I'll wait here a while for him

289
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:41,099
In other words, we travel westwards,
wandering hoodlums who think we 're samurai

290
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,607
The souls accompanying us drift up to the sky
If they flap their wings, they can fly

291
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:50,362
In other words, we travel westwards,
wandering hoodlums who think we 're samurai

292
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:55,037
The souls accompanying us drift up to the sky
If they flap their wings, they can fly

293
00:22:55,124 --> 00:23:02,087
And so, he himself had no idea that
he had inadvertently saved this country.

294
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:09,214
His thoughts were turned to the distant land
to which the black ships were returning.

295
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,469
My thoughts aren't really turned
anywhere. Stop making stuff up!

296
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,802
Who the hell are you, anyway?
Shut your damn mouth!

297
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,262
Yes, sir...
