1
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,589
Pirates!

2
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,887
It's pirates! They're coming right at us!

3
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,681
Starboard! Starboard!

4
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,781
P-Please, wait...!

5
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,959
T-Take whatever you want, just spare my life!

6
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,939
" Misguided Miscreants, Part 1
(A Dark Night's Passing, Part 1 )"

7
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,907
Let's rest.

8
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,572
I can't take another step...

9
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,126
We're lost because somebody
wanted to take a shortcut!

10
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,000
Aw, quit your bitching. We're doin' just fine.

11
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,707
Take a look around! What makes
you think we're doing fine?!

12
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,714
I can smell it. It's the sea.

13
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:00,920
The sea?

14
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,175
Yeah. It's right up ahead.

15
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,847
Really?!

16
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,615
The sea!

17
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,540
It's freezing!

18
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,218
I thought you said you couldn't
take another step, you little flake.

19
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,426
I swear...

20
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,528
Mugen? It can't be...

21
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,321
Is that you, Mugen?

22
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,699
You're alive...!

23
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,510
Hey, what's going on? Who is she?

24
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,560
Take all the money they've got!

25
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,641
Darn it, what the heck is going on?

26
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,479
--Crap...
--These two are pretty tough!

27
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,690
Wait! Stop it!

28
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,695
These people are--

29
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,367
Stay out of this, you're just the bait!

30
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,302
I never expected to see you again in this life.

31
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,755
Isn't that right, Mugen?

32
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:15,015
I always figured the next time
we met would be in Hell.

33
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:20,146
In that case, what say I send you
on your way there, Mukuro?

34
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:27,070
Talk about lucky. What a stroke of luck.

35
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,493
We haven't been attacking people
just 'cause we want their money.

36
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,118
I've been looking for the
toughest bastards around.

37
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,324
What the hell for?

38
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,579
You're the perfect man for the job.

39
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,755
The heist we're gonna pull is gonna be huge.

40
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,710
I'll pay you more more
money than you can imagine.

41
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,044
No thanks.

42
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,505
What's the matter? You scared?

43
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,932
I don't work with anyone.

44
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,101
I thought I told you that
the last time you asked.

45
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,181
Oh? What do you call these two, then?

46
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,642
They ain't my friends or anything.

47
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:06,150
I promised I'd protect 'em until
we get to Nagasaki, that's all.

48
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,405
Protect them, huh? You?

49
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,532
Oh, that's funny! That's a laugh riot!

50
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,866
Hey, do you have any idea what
kinds of things this guy has done?

51
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,079
You have any idea how many people he's killed?

52
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:27,293
This is hysterical!
A guy like you is protecting people?

53
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,592
Yeah, that's more like it.
That's the kind of guy you are.

54
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,768
You remember now?

55
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,599
Mugen? Hey!

56
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,309
Wait!

57
00:06:55,415 --> 00:07:00,205
Really? That Mukuro guy is your big brother?

58
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:04,379
You don't look anything alike, um...

59
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,047
My name is Koza.

60
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,924
Mugen, Mukuro and I used to
live on the island together.

61
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,380
Ever since we were little.

62
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,590
Island?

63
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:19,428
A little island down in the Ryukyus...

64
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,731
An island where they exile criminals.

65
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,561
An island... that is just like Hell.

66
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:36,028
Everyone on the island is a
criminal who was exiled there.

67
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:41,037
Mugen, Mukuro and I were
all born and raised there.

68
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,416
That place was the only world we knew.

69
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,634
He said that you were going to Nagasaki, right?

70
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:58,308
Oh! That's right. There's a samurai
there who smells of sunflowers.

71
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,475
Sunflowers?

72
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,177
You know him?

73
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,604
No, I don't.

74
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,525
But to get back onto the
highway that goes to Nagasaki,

75
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:11,605
I think your best bet is to take a
boat and cross straight over to Ise.

76
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,611
A boat?

77
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,194
I'll go look for a boat we can use.

78
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,698
A boat, huh?

79
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,783
Forget about it, a boat's just
gonna sink, and then we'll all die.

80
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,995
I think you'll be okay if Mugen is with you.

81
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,672
He knows how to work a boat?

82
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,545
Of course.

83
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,252
Mugen never said anything about that to you?

84
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,560
But...

85
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:47,016
That means that he'll be leaving again...

86
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,646
What's the matter?

87
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:56,655
Nothing, I just... I wish I could be
with Mugen, just like in the old days.

88
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:01,830
It didn't look like he and his big brother
were on very good terms, though...

89
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:06,250
I wish my big brother was dead...

90
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:10,831
Well, with a brother like him, I guess
I can understand why you'd say that...

91
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,964
But if you really hate him that much, you don't
have to force yourself to stay with him.

92
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,341
I can't leave.

93
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,391
I mean, I could never survive on my own.

94
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,124
What's up with this village?

95
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,926
I don't see a single person around.

96
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,609
You trying to tell me that
you've forgotten all about it?

97
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,941
About that darkness you got in your soul?

98
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,306
Do you have any last words?

99
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,603
Hurry up and get it over with.

100
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,150
Going to Hell don't bother me any.

101
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,604
Life here is pretty much a living Hell, anyway.

102
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:02,159
But the thought of bein' killed by
you bastards rubs me the wrong way.

103
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,157
I lived my life without any help from anybody.

104
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:09,116
And now that I'm gonna die, I'm gonna send
myself to Hell without any help from you.

105
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,891
Son of a... Shoot! Shoot him!

106
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:34,566
That little fool... Did he think he could
save himself by jumping off this cliff?

107
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:56,622
Got it? First one to pull on his reins loses.

108
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,885
If I win, you work with me. All right?

109
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,085
You bastard...

110
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,163
You remember now?

111
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:43,548
In the end, you and I are
just a couple of cursed men.

112
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:47,381
There isn't anywhere that we can run to.

113
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:56,724
They killed everyone but the young men. No one
was spared, not even the women and children.

114
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,810
My guess is that they then
forced the men to fight each other,

115
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,362
and the survivors are now part of the gang.

116
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,163
We're better off not getting
involved with that man, Mukuro.

117
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,582
Once it's morning, let's leave.

118
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,871
--Mugen!
--I'm gonna take the job.

119
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,709
Hey, wait a minute!
What about us going to Nagasaki?

120
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,919
Either way, we need money, don't we?

121
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,470
Yeah, but that doesn't mean you--

122
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:31,641
He was clearly trying to provoke you.
Did you fall for that?

123
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:36,267
I changed my mind. End of story.

124
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,847
As you wish.

125
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,275
You think I'm gonna take orders from you, jack?

126
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,604
Mugen! Hey, wait!

127
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,314
Mugen!

128
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,535
I knew you'd come.

129
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,496
Get it straight. I have one condition.

130
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,252
Like what?

131
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:08,554
Once this job is done, I never wanna
see your ugly mug ever again. Got it?

132
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:19,937
Listen up. Our target is a Shogunate transport
ship that's carrying 60,000 ryo in gold coins.

133
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:24,941
This transport that's carrying a
60,000 ryo tribute from Osaka to Edo

134
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,523
will be anchoring off the shore here tonight.

135
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:33,703
They're letting their sailors rest, and will
take on fresh supplies of food and water.

136
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,496
That's when we'll hit them.

137
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,699
Wait a minute.

138
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,706
Where the hell did you get
all this information from?

139
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,416
I have somebody on the transport ship
who's been leaking information to me.

140
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,548
The mole is a member of my gang.

141
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,302
First, Ken and Ryu take
the place of the real workers

142
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,884
and carry the barrels of supplies onto the ship.

143
00:14:55,978 --> 00:15:00,847
One of those barrels will be
carrying a bomb. In other words, me.

144
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,560
I'll use the gunpowder bomb to damage the ship.

145
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,522
While I'm doing that, the rest of you
ram our pirate ship into them.

146
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,483
After that, it's business as usual.

147
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,819
We board the transport ship,
overwhelm them, and take everything.

148
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,951
The 60,000 ryo, and their lives.

149
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,124
And last of all, we'll blow it
to smithereens with these.

150
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,422
But this is a government transport, you know?

151
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,502
Yeah, it's gonna have dozens
of skilled guards on board.

152
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,837
But we don't have enough people to--

153
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,890
That's why tonight is our only shot.

154
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,970
It's gonna rain tonight.
And no moonlight, either.

155
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,602
We'll use that darkness to our advantage.
We'll be on 'em before they see us coming.

156
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,649
But it's clear outside!

157
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,317
Is it really gonna rain?

158
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,521
--No doubt about it.
--Say what?

159
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,982
I can smell it. On the wind.

160
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,656
Now that we have that settled,
it's time to put the plan into action.

161
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,750
The wind sure has picked up outside...

162
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,129
I wonder if Mugen is gonna be okay?

163
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,959
He will reap what he sows.

164
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,170
Well, yeah, but still...

165
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,856
Mugen...

166
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:31,734
Do you remember? We looked
up at the stars like this once.

167
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,065
You told me something then.

168
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,702
Looking down from up there, we wouldn't
look any bigger than grains of sand.

169
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,702
Doesn't ring any bells.

170
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:52,296
If we had been born someplace else,
someplace other than that island,

171
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,968
I wonder what kind of people we'd be?

172
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,217
Mugen, are you happy now?

173
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,645
I ain't given it much thought.

174
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,939
Fuu is really lucky.

175
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,516
You think so?

176
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:14,481
Yeah... Because she gets to be with you, Mugen.

177
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,620
Mugen...

178
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,199
I want to be with you, too. Just like she is.

179
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,501
I want to run away from here.

180
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,966
So let's run away. Together.

181
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:40,131
Sorry, lady. I ain't that kinda guy.

182
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,976
See ya.

183
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,709
We've brought your water and supplies.

184
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,135
Well done.

185
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,133
I'll inspect the cargo, if you don't mind.

186
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,089
Y-Yes, sir.

187
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,601
--Something wrong?
--Well, sir, considering this weather...

188
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,150
If we don't get these brought
on board soon, they'll get soaked.

189
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,196
You have a point...
All right, load them on board!

190
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,577
Got it? I'm going to kill all of our men.

191
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,704
Once the job's done,
we'll rendezvous with Shiren.

192
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,331
What about Mugen?

193
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,672
Let's get going.

194
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,702
--W-Who's there?!
--Oh, I'm so sorry. My hand slipped.

195
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,079
Who the hell are you?!

196
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,584
Don't worry, I'll make sure the next
one goes right through your brain.

197
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,711
Don't be so jumpy!

198
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,677
Here goes!

199
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,071
What the hell is going on?

200
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,540
Take these insolent dogs who
have no respect for authority...

201
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,539
...and mow them down!

202
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,042
I thought he was gonna blow these guys up!

203
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,343
Save Mugen! Please, save Mugen!

204
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,463
What do you mean by that?

205
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,095
So, it was a trap.

206
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,328
Mukuro, you son of a bitch!

207
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,250
You played me, didn't you?!

208
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,717
Oh, crap!

209
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,256
Damn you, you bastard!

210
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,801
Mukuro!

211
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,184
The pirate ship!

212
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,065
What? Which one is it?

213
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,771
Mugen's on it!

214
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,244
Mugen!

215
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:40,079
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

216
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:44,167
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

217
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:52,392
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

218
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,972
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels

219
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:02,022
Spring is announced when the
wild plants break out in a dance

220
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:07,274
Summer comes to Uji, and in the fields
are patterns of grass set out to dry

221
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:12,453
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

222
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:17,120
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

223
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:23,374
I can still see the too-distant blue sky
when I close my eyes (It was so warm)

224
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:28,299
As I reminisce, I take your hand
as I pluck flowers and sing

225
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:33,429
Within the memories that
are now coming back to me

226
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,354
I'm setting out to find my way back to you

227
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:43,647
Spring is announced when the
mountain leaves break out in dance

228
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:48,990
Summer comes to Uji, and textiles with
plains grass patterns are set out to dry

229
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:54,070
The autumn moon rises,
let's celebrate its fullness

230
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,791
Winter passes by, and I count off
the days and months again

231
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:03,121
Dawn comes, and we part ways once again

232
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,174
My dreams becoming distant apparitions

233
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:15,347
I turn to the warm wind for help,
the wind I felt every time you held me

234
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:20,726
As I was bathed in the light
that followed on your heels
