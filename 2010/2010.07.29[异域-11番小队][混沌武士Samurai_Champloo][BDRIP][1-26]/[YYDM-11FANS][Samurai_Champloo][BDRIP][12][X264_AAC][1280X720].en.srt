1
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:42,178
This hot bath feels so good...

2
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,682
My point is, don't you think this is fishy?

3
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,761
How so?

4
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,018
For starters, what the hell
are we even traveling for?

5
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,317
To search for the samurai who
smells of sunflowers, as I recall.

6
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,644
That's what I'm sayin'!

7
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:58,904
I mean, she ain't told us one damn thing
about who this sunflower dude is.

8
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,111
--Yes, that's true...
--Not even that one time.

9
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:07,124
I've been meaning to ask you about that...

10
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,747
Who is this samurai who smells of sunflowers?

11
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,500
--Well, he...
--And what the hell is a sunflower, anyway?

12
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,546
Hey, wait a minute...

13
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,420
--You don't know?
--It's a flower! A flower!

14
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,795
What do they smell like?

15
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,172
Do you have any other leads?

16
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,174
--Like a picture or something?
--What made you decide to come here?

17
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,722
Oh, for crying out loud!

18
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,098
Don't you think she's gets kinda
evasive when we bring up that stuff?

19
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:31,353
And now she says that
we're heading for Nagasaki!

20
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,065
There is only one thing that I can tell you.

21
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,446
If you go to Nagasaki, I am sure
that you will find some answers.

22
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,276
Nagasaki...

23
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,705
All we've got is that guy's
unreliable information.

24
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:51,627
But that man was the chief merchant of
the East India Company's Japan branch.

25
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,419
I doubt that information from a
man like that would be unreliable.

26
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,747
You think so?

27
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,004
Besides, with no other information
to go on, we have no other choice.

28
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,086
That's my point! That's what I'm sayin'!

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,388
No way in hell she doesn't know anything else.

30
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:07,434
She's hiding something from us!

31
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,977
Okay, then...

32
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:09,974
What are you doing?

33
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,307
I'm gonna snoop around a little
while she's taking her bath.

34
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,155
--Here we go...
--Hey, don't go through
other people's belongings.

35
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:31,709
Don't sweat it. It's her own damn
fault for not telling us anything.

36
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,871
What?

37
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,457
--I can't read.
--Give me that.

38
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,715
It seems to be a diary.

39
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,091
A diary?

40
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:49,267
Great, there's bound to be some secrets
about that sunflower dude written in there.

41
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,347
Hey, read it out loud, damn it.

42
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,058
"July 1 0th. Sunny.

43
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,691
It's almost been a year since Mom died. "

44
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:04,195
I had always told myself that I would set out
on a journey, but I never had the courage,

45
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:09,701
so I've been working and
living at uncle 's teahouse.

46
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,203
But the day has finally come for me to set out.

47
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:16,583
I've made up my mind that starting
today, I'm going to keep this diary

48
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,837
until I find the samurai who smells of
sunflowers so that I won 't forget this journey.

49
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:26,968
And so, I have now filled out the first page.

50
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,556
"The Disorder Diaries (Learning From the Past) "

51
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,765
Admittedly, the teahouse burned down,
so I don't have any choice but to start my trip.

52
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,474
Parentheses, smiley face.

53
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:42,609
And the fire was caused by
a couple of unbelievable guys.

54
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,783
The first one to show up at the teahouse
was a crude and vulgar guy with wild hair.

55
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,159
What, does she mean me?

56
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,994
The instant I saw him, I thought he was a bad
person who would commit all sorts of crimes,

57
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,171
and was the type of person that I would never
want to be friends with in a million years.

58
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,247
Say what?!

59
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,301
But then, once I talked to him...

60
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,002
...I learned that I was right about him.

61
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,930
--Watch it, you bitch!
--What are you getting angry at the diary for?

62
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,475
I'll admit that I needed help because
the stupid son of the governor

63
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,803
thought he could do whatever he wanted.

64
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,604
But even so...

65
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:22,562
Once he got started, he didn 't know when
to stop. I mean, he really went overboard.

66
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,738
If I knew he was going to be like that,
I would've taken my chances

67
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,281
with the governor's son.

68
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,529
Why, you little...

69
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,284
Just then, another man appeared.
One with long hair and glasses.

70
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,785
She talkin' about you?

71
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,585
Unlike the first one, I thought that
this new guy was kinda attractive.

72
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,591
But it was like this new guy refused
to stop fighting once he 'd started, too.

73
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,671
Deep down, maybe they're two of a kind.

74
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,596
How rude. Don't compare me--

75
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,845
--to a guy like him!

76
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:56,053
Anyway, that was how I came
to set out on my journey

77
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,230
accompanied by these two men, Mugen and Jin.

78
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,649
The end.

79
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,148
July 1 1th. Sunny.

80
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,699
Something lousy happened to me
because of those two going crazy yesterday.

81
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,277
A guy showed up, saying something
about Mugen cutting his arm off.

82
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,456
I can't have you waking up just yet.

83
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,797
And that's how my life as a
hostage suddenly started. Geez...

84
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,126
Well, I was drunk at the time,
so I don't remember much.

85
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,175
The end.

86
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,719
The end, she says?!

87
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,342
She left out a lot...

88
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,392
P.S. The Joushuu grilled manjuu
buns we had were yummy.

89
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,976
July 14th. Sunny, then cloudy.

90
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,103
I had another terrible experience
today because of those two.

91
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,152
It all started when they
ditched me and ran away!

92
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,982
Thanks to that, I ended up
in a whorehouse this time!

93
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,738
A pervert was about to have his way with me,

94
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,320
but I was saved by an old fortune teller woman.

95
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,492
I would beware of vases if I were you.

96
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,702
A vase?

97
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,082
A vase...

98
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,084
A little vase...

99
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,757
Take this!

100
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,922
July 1 9th.

101
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,133
Out of the blue, I was kidnapped
and held prisoner! Oh, man...

102
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:21,096
Don't you think my life
is a little too eventful?

103
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,977
Or more to the point, now that I think about it,

104
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:27,061
why do these things keep happening to
me even though I have two bodyguards?

105
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,023
Those bozos are pretty useless, don 't you think?

106
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,951
I'm starting to think that
I picked the wrong people.

107
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,372
It all started when we had to find work to
earn money for the ferry across the river.

108
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,163
I'm Moronobu Hishikawa.

109
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,540
I'm an artist who hasn't
quite made the big time yet.

110
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,040
Pleased to meet you.

111
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,968
I thought he was kinda cute,
even if he was a bit of a poser.

112
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,639
Maybe that's where I made my mistake...

113
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,467
I went ahead and modeled for his Ukiyo-e,

114
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:03,146
but now that I think about it,
what did I see in him?

115
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:09,604
Still, unlike those two jerks,
he said nice things to me.

116
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:13,065
Yeah, this is definitely all their fault, too.

117
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,696
Don't blame us for your own screwups, lady!

118
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:20,952
He said that he was going to go to Holland,
but I wonder what happened to him?

119
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,704
Is he on a ship right now?

120
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:27,162
Or maybe he's already arrived over there...

121
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:35,839
He, meaning Moronobu Hishikawa, was caught
immediately and never made it to Holland.

122
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,969
In reality, he was still in that area.

123
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,597
However, there was no way
she could have known

124
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:47,900
that he would be known to future
generations as the father of Ukiyo-e painting.

125
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:53,356
It is as if talent and character are
often found in inverse proportion.

126
00:08:54,534 --> 00:09:00,154
P.S. The grilled squid mantles and squid
tentacles he bought for me were delicious.

127
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,739
You know, something just occured to me...

128
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,789
Like what?

129
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,459
Why were we going to Edo then, anyway?

130
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,834
--I don't know.
--Isn't there anything written in there?

131
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,505
"4th Annual Big Eater Contest
Sponsored by Anago Fukuyoshi and Manpukuji "

132
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,173
Today, I was able to eat all I could
for the first time in ages. I'm so happy!

133
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,721
I might have to go
without food again after this,

134
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,049
so I'm gonna eat enough to tide me over.

135
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,384
Is she an animal?

136
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:28,145
What I ate yesterday and today includes eel
rice bowls, loach stew, and Edo-style sushi.

137
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,065
They were all yummy.

138
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,611
You hear lots of people say,
"There 's always room for dessert, "

139
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:38,783
but in my case, it's like it should be,
"There 's always room for free food. "

140
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,155
I wonder if everybody is like that?

141
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,033
It's just you!

142
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,991
I also got to see kabuki
and fireworks, which was neat.

143
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,792
The end.

144
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,498
Hey, wait a minute! Isn't there anything
about the sunflower samurai in there?

145
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,675
All that's in there is stuff about food!

146
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,926
Oh, that reminds me.
Starting today, we are going to Nagasaki.

147
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:05,010
Well, the only reason I came to Edo was
because I'd heard rumors that he was here,

148
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,972
so it's not like I had any
hard evidence or anything.

149
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,101
She can't be serious.

150
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,559
That little flake... She dragged us
all that way just on a stupid rumor?

151
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,394
I can't believe it.

152
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,033
I got taken hostage again! Geez!

153
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:28,037
In the whole world, who else but me
could be taken hostage this often?

154
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:32,041
Plus, my wallet got stolen,
and I wasn 't able to eat...

155
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,379
I dreamed about Mom today.

156
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,933
It was the first time that I'd
thought about Mom in a long time.

157
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:51,310
So much has happened to me on this
journey that I haven 't had time to miss her,

158
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,483
so I haven 't felt this way for a long time.

159
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,115
I don 't think I can write about Shinsuke.

160
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:05,070
I couldn't bring myself to say
anything to his mother, either.

161
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:10,034
But once some time has passed
and I've sorted out my feelings,

162
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,165
I definitely want to write a letter to her.

163
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:17,215
I want to tell her all those things that
I wanted to say then, but couldn 't.

164
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:24,048
It is difficult for anyone to
predict what the future holds.

165
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:28,055
Incidentally, this is a prediction
of the lives of people in the future,

166
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:34,062
taken from Mudaiki, a speculative fiction work
by Edo dime novel author Harumachi Koikawa.

167
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,987
As you can see here, predicting the
future is something of a tricky business.

168
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:44,613
Or more to the point, what's up
with those dumbass hairstyles?

169
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,031
We left Edo and headed for Nagasaki.

170
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,958
Well, that was the idea, but we're still in Edo.

171
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,958
We can 't make any headway at all
'cause we 've got no money.

172
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,383
But we managed to get a meal thanks to
the money we got from pawning Jin 's glasses.

173
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,426
It was yummy.

174
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:08,133
But they went tottering away
after some older woman, the louses.

175
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,641
It's not like I'm jealous or anything.

176
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:16,691
It's just that it's a problem when they don 't
carry out their duties as my bodyguards.

177
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:22,023
Well, I guess she was kinda sexy.
She had big boobs.

178
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,358
Is that the kinda women they go for?

179
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,661
But I got hit on today, too.

180
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,411
Admittedly, he didn't make a lick of sense...

181
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,994
This woman is going to take some work.

182
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,173
But the thing is, that only makes
her all the more worthwhile.

183
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,170
Yo, honey.

184
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,968
Who, me? I'm a man who's gonna be big.

185
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:48,048
My name is Nagamitsu Sakon Shogen!

186
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,930
I kinda get the feeling
that I only attract weirdos.

187
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,761
Geez, what's a girl to do?

188
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:59,146
In the end, we earned some money with a
street performance, and were able to leave Edo.

189
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:03,822
But it feels like I've lost
sight of my objective...

190
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,116
We're supposed to be looking for
the samurai who smells of sunflowers,

191
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,946
but we 're always trying to scrounge up
enough money to cover living expenses.

192
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,125
I guess what I'm trying to write is,
"Getting by in life sure is hard. "

193
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,748
The end.

194
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,956
P.S. The pear was yummy.

195
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:26,925
By the way, there has been a recent uproar
over rampant sexuality in the country's youth.

196
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:31,054
However, the Japanese people originally had
a rather open-minded view towards sexuality,

197
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:35,638
and it was especially liberal
during the Edo Period.

198
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:41,193
They only became prudish in the Meiji Era
after the influx of Western culture.

199
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,567
On the contrary, then, one could say
that they have merely returned

200
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,069
to the values of the Edo Period.

201
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,947
And if we delve into world history,

202
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:54,122
Japan 's Edo Period can be
placed alongside ancient Greece

203
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,950
in that it was an era in
which gay love flourished,

204
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:04,633
and in which homosexuality was considered to
be more noble a pursuit than heterosexuality.

205
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,051
Incidentally, please forgive my
extremely delayed introduction.

206
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,971
My name is Manzou the Saw.

207
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:15,223
I'm a secret policeman who fights
night and day in the name of peace.

208
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,639
I got taken prisoner again! Geez!

209
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,771
We finally left Edo and got as far
as the Hakone Checkpoint,

210
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,524
but we got conned by a scalper.

211
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:29,528
It seems like I've been
tricked a lot on this journey.

212
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,201
Am I too trusting?

213
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,121
Maybe I ought to be
more suspicious of people...

214
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,870
Am I a bad judge of character?

215
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,201
I had a lot to think about today.

216
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,629
The worst part of it all is that jerk, Mugen.

217
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,877
I believed in him, thinking
that he 'd come back for us.

218
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,085
What kind of rescuer ends up
needing to be rescued, huh?

219
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,638
Anyway, I've decided never to trust him again.

220
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,264
Suits me fine! Go ahead and
don't trust me, see if I care!

221
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:03,066
By the way, I spent a lot of time with Jin
because that jerk Mugen didn't come back.

222
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:09,273
Now that I think about it, that was the first
time that I had spent any time alone with Jin.

223
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:15,283
I thought to myself, "We 're going to
have a deep, heart-to-heart conversation, "

224
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,365
but that Jin kept his mouth shut the whole time.

225
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:23,044
At times like that, don't guys usually open up
and start telling you all sorts of stuff?

226
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:28,125
I tried to break the ice a few times,
but all he 'd say was, "Hmm, " and "Mmm "!

227
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,962
What's his problem?!
Does he hate me or something?

228
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,093
Or is he just shy?

229
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,893
I mean, it's been a while
since we started our journey,

230
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,097
so when is he finally gonna open up to me?

231
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,307
It's kinda sad, really.

232
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,142
The end.

233
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,570
Hey. As a man, what do you think of her?

234
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,397
Hmm...

235
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,028
This guy's hopeless.

236
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,322
The 1 950s, San Francisco.

237
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:04,707
The youth of the so-called Beat Generation
were profoundly influenced by Zen.

238
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:10,633
And that influence was inherited
by the Hippies of the 1 960s.

239
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,384
The youths who dropped out of society
turned away from civilized society,

240
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:20,014
tripped on psychedelic music,
and searched for true freedom.

241
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:24,188
It is said among these Hippies were some
who approached Zen as a counterculture,

242
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:30,316
chanted Buddhist sutras,
burned incense, and practiced meditation.

243
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,364
Elsewhere, in Edo Period Japan...

244
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,409
Although they weren 't searching
for anything in particular,

245
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:40,489
here we find people deep in mediation.

246
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,952
And if one were to ask why
these people are doing this...?

247
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:55,344
Sorry, friend, but we don't
even have money for lodgings.

248
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,389
We don't have anything to give you as alms.

249
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,058
I'm glad to hear you say that.

250
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,933
Starting today, we will be
staying at this Zen temple.

251
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,646
They're letting us sleep and eat here for free,
so I thought it was more than we could hope for,

252
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,029
but in return, we have to
follow the rules of the temple.

253
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,486
I've been hard at work since
the crack of dawn again today.

254
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,446
Boy, am I beat...

255
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,790
Man is naturally born into a state of freedom.

256
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,293
He is not born so that he might
submit to rules or a master.

257
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,921
This thought has occured to me.

258
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:40,007
But does this not contradict
the duties of a warrior?

259
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:46,597
Freedom is neither won through painful struggle,
nor can it be forced into existence.

260
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:55,030
What's more, freedom has absolutely nothing
to do with one's social status or profession.

261
00:17:55,116 --> 00:18:02,329
To simply accept yourself as you are,
and as you live, to let it be.

262
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,077
In this is freedom.

263
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:12,004
Because of those guys, I've had
lots of terrible things happen to me.

264
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:18,178
I sometimes ask myself if I picked
the right people to travel with.

265
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,677
All encounters happen but once in a lifetime.

266
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:28,730
If you have met these two men and are
traveling with them, then that is your destiny.

267
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:33,526
Whatever the outcome of your journey may be...

268
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:42,535
Hey, I wanna make myself stronger, chrome dome.

269
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,159
I wanna beat that bastard.

270
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,456
Hey, are you listening to me, baldy?

271
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:52,003
What I can do to beat him?
Start talking, cue ball!

272
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,206
--Katsu!
--Ow!

273
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,633
The moon's so big...

274
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,635
Well, I'm heading out for a bit.

275
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,514
Hey, you haven't forgotten, have you?

276
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:13,976
You're gonna help me look for the
samurai who smells of sunflowers, right?

277
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,560
Yeah, I know.

278
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,146
Don't forget.

279
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,073
I will be the one who kills you.

280
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,119
Looking back on things now, I might
have gone through a lot of lousy things,

281
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,868
but it was neat to experience
all sorts of new things.

282
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:34,705
If I hadn 't met them in the teahouse that day,
I might still be working there right now.

283
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,383
When I think of it that way,
maybe it's just like Father Zuikou says,

284
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,836
and it was a once-in-a-lifetime,
chance encounter.

285
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:46,550
I don 't know how much longer
it will take to reach Nagasaki,

286
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:51,684
but I hope that the three of us
can keep traveling to the very end.

287
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,938
I'm positive that those two
are thinking the same thing.

288
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,690
Yeah. That's the decision I've made.

289
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,440
Don't make up other people's minds for them...

290
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,617
--Right?
--Hmm...

291
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,114
I'm just kidding!

292
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:12,041
Those two might peek at my diary
without asking, so I made all this up.

293
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,040
Serves you right, you jerks!

294
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:19,795
You... You little bitch!

295
00:20:54,712 --> 00:21:05,884
Take me along to where you are

296
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:17,100
I'll be like the wind and breathe quietly

297
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:26,738
Take me with you, where have you gone?

298
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:38,120
I'll open up my heart and cross over time

299
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:47,133
A shimmering sunny place, white and so far away

300
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:52,763
I'll unravel those aimless memories

301
00:21:52,853 --> 00:22:01,898
The fragrant sunflowers are still
patiently holding on to their petals

302
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,443
Please tell me

303
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:08,400
I'm nervous about learning everything

304
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:14,865
So why do I still want to know about
these uncertain emotions inside me?

305
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,575
Spring, Summer, Fall,
and Winter play their tunes

306
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,412
Each on its own journey towards tomorrow

307
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,966
And before I know it,
I'm with you at the end of my dream

308
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:36,270
Take me along to where you are

309
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:47,732
I'll be like the wind and breathe quietly

310
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:57,370
Take me with you, where are you going?

311
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:08,502
I'll open up my heart and cross over time
