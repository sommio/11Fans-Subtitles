1
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,139
I never met anybody like him before.

2
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,776
I know he 's still alive.

3
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,955
Something in my gut says he is.

4
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:09,869
" Lullabies of the Lost, Verse 1
(Idling Your Life Away, Verse 1 )"

5
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,168
Isn't there an easier road to take?

6
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:23,349
It's not like we're making the
Kumano pilgrimage or anything.

7
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,848
Isn't there a shortcut or something
that'll get us to the west faster?

8
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,271
I'm not familiar with the West.

9
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,395
More to the point, what's up with that?

10
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,568
It'll be the same no matter which road we take.

11
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,442
Anyway, when we're mixed in
with a crowd like this,

12
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,239
if any idiots are after us,
they won't spot us, right?

13
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,659
What, are you guys criminals or something?

14
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,283
Yep, that's right. I've been a
criminal since the day I was born.

15
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,491
You think it might be
because I'm so good lookin'?

16
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,419
He's an idiot. He's just your average idiot.

17
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:59,002
So, ladies... Wanna go over there
where the grass is nice 'n tall?

18
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,553
What did you have in mind?

19
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,595
All sorts of things.

20
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,220
He's a perv! Your average perv!

21
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,599
But they say that there's a dangerous
monster here deep in the mountains.

22
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,055
A monster?

23
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,891
What did they say it was? A Tengu? A Kappa?

24
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,477
No, a crow monster, remember?
The kind with lots of legs.

25
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,779
Oh, don't let that kinda talk scare you.

26
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,610
Rumors like that always start with somebody
mistaking a bear or something for a monster.

27
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,197
And as the rumor spreads
from one person to the next,

28
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:33,456
it gets more and distorted,
and before you know it, it's a monster.

29
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,788
Hey, what're you doing?! Cut it out!

30
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,252
Jerk! Pervert!

31
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,004
Sleazeball!

32
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,045
Ow...

33
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,631
His libido plays second fiddle
to his stomach, I guess.

34
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:49,014
That monster's gotta be Yoshitsune.

35
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,059
Yo!

36
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,308
He haunts it, haunts it, haunts it,
haunts this mountain!

37
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,358
This mountain's haunted by Yoshitsune's...

38
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,651
It's gotta be his ghost!

39
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,525
--Yoshitsune...
--What? Who's that?

40
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,027
He's the cat who was
famous throughout the land,

41
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:06,110
--seven shaku high, a mountain of a man!
--Yo!

42
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,571
--He killed a thou-- a thou-- a thousand men!
--That wasn't...

43
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:16,003
What makes him badder is that he was
quick as an adder, leaping here and there!

44
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,128
And they say that as a handsome man,
his looks were unmatched in all the land!

45
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,254
They seem to be mixing up different rumors.

46
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,712
--Well!
--Don't blame us, that's just the rumor!

47
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,422
Y'know?

48
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,307
So what is it that's in these mountains?

49
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,979
Rumors. Nothing but rumors.

50
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,156
Gotta take a leak... Gotta take a leak...

51
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,828
Well, it definitely don't look like we're
dealin' with a Tengu or a Kappa here...

52
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,505
Hey, are you sure this is a shortcut?

53
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,756
C'mon, what made you decide to go this way?

54
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,555
Cause it looks like there
really is something living here.

55
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,678
There's something in these mountains.

56
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:14,603
Of course there are things
living here. So what's your point?

57
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,271
It sounds interesting. Am I right?

58
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,060
Learning the truth behind this
"ghost of Yoshitsune" business

59
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,110
does have my interest piqued.

60
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,284
--I knew it all along.
--Knew what?

61
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:34,957
That you two are totally incapable
of following the scent of sunflowers.

62
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,669
All you're interested in is
being with a cute girl like me.

63
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,671
You aren't the least bit interested in trying
to find the sunflower samurai anymore!

64
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,506
I hate it when people get the
wrong impression about me.

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,342
You don't think I'm interested in looking
for your sunflower samurai anymore?

66
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,973
Well, I gotta tell you...

67
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,020
I never was interested!

68
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,521
And as for wanting to be with you, I never
gave that a second thought, either!

69
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,023
I never gave it a first thought!

70
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,947
You think you're cute, huh?

71
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,149
Not bloody likely!

72
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,031
Why have you stayed
with me all this time, then?!

73
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,612
It just worked out that way! Pure chance!

74
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,447
Stop this. It's unseemly.

75
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,079
Even this silent poindexter
was thinking the same thing.

76
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,913
Hanging around this girl who's got
zero sex appeal is no fun at all.

77
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,249
That last remark went too far.

78
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,004
Yeah, you tell him!

79
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,711
I can't overlook that
"silent poindexter" comment.

80
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,548
--You're mad about that?!
--And anyway...

81
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,601
A samurai who smells of sunflowers?
What's up with that?

82
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:41,182
Why do you wanna find
a pansy like that, anyway?

83
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,561
He's not like that!

84
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,062
What's he like, then?!

85
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,645
W-Well, he's...

86
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,732
See what I mean? You don't
know anything about him, either.

87
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,943
Don't tell me that you don't
even know what he looks like...

88
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,124
How come you're so desperate to find this guy

89
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,247
when you don't even know
for sure if he's alive or dead?

90
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,588
He's alive!

91
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,839
Until I find him and beat him up,
he's gonna stay alive no matter what.

92
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,761
This is about revenge?

93
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,839
What's it matter to you?

94
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,926
I bet this guy raped you and
threw you away like garbage,

95
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,602
and now you're out for revenge, right?

96
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:26,064
Oh, okay. Now I get it.
It's all clear to me now!

97
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,318
Listen, you two are nothing
more than hired muscle,

98
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,865
so I'm gonna trade up to
tougher models! I'm trading up!

99
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,238
Gimme a break!

100
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,913
A loudmouthed little girl like
you ain't gonna fire me! I quit!

101
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,615
--Hey...
--Fine, fine, I understand.

102
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,826
Your services are no longer required.

103
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,089
Goodbye.

104
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,292
That's a load off my mind! See ya!

105
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,672
Hey...!

106
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,754
You retarded coward!

107
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,464
You closet pervert halfwit!

108
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,016
Those two are--

109
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,199
Screw it. See if I care!

110
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,761
Momo?

111
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,180
Come down! Hey, wait!

112
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,808
I don't want you to leave me, too!

113
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,494
Momo?

114
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,452
Don't! Stay off me!

115
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,976
Aw, man! This is bad!

116
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,429
I forgot to kill that bastard before I left!

117
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,312
Crap... This woulda been my perfect chance, too.

118
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,948
Bastard!

119
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,201
What's the big idea?!

120
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,795
Bastard...

121
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,838
Do you work for Matsumae domain?

122
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:45,016
Where the hell is that?
And who the hell are you?!

123
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,188
You got the wrong guy! Apologize, dammit!

124
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,757
I can't hold on...

125
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,709
...any longer...

126
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,488
As I suspected.

127
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,163
I see that your skills have improved, Yukimaru.

128
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,833
So, even you have come after me for revenge?

129
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,377
When Ogura was unable to carry out his plan,

130
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,001
he took his own life.

131
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,004
But I'm not like those others from the dojo.

132
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,633
There's no point in avenging our master's death.

133
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,637
With the dojo gone now,
all everyone talks about is you.

134
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,810
I'm sick of it.

135
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,728
You wish to make a name for yourself?

136
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,728
When you killed our master,
that's exactly what you did.

137
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,758
Why do you keep running away?!

138
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,086
I have no desire to kill you.

139
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,968
You aren't good enough to kill me!

140
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,018
You aren't worth killing.

141
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:56,064
If I killed you, it would only tarnish my sword.

142
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,103
I won't always be the same
little boy I used to be!

143
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,564
Your time in the sun is over!

144
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,573
What's the matter?

145
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,876
Shall we continue and go to Hell together?

146
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,549
Say that you killed me if you like.

147
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,970
I might as well be dead already.

148
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,317
This is bad...

149
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,523
I'm gonna die...

150
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,990
I'm actually gonna die...

151
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,164
Please, help me...

152
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,914
Somebody, please help me...

153
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,101
Why, you!

154
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,369
Momo!

155
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,752
Um...

156
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,507
You were carried here by the river.

157
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,180
I was?

158
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,759
Does my appearance seem so strange to you?

159
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,561
No, it's not that. I just...

160
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,897
Really, can I?

161
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,200
Don't mind if I do!

162
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,700
Yum, this is so good!

163
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,579
A woman with a healthy
appetite is a beautiful one.

164
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:04,142
You've done so much to help me...
But I can't do anything to repay you.

165
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,599
Momo, come here.

166
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,105
What's with you?

167
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,858
I think it's because I have these.

168
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,194
Sunflower seeds...

169
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,371
Geez, you're such a little mercenary...

170
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,536
Well, thank you for everything.

171
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,417
Ow, that hurts...

172
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,754
Um, what're you--

173
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,596
These medicinal herbs are good for wounds.

174
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,474
Leave them there for a while,
and it will feel better.

175
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,850
Thank you.

176
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,057
The forest is dangerous at night.

177
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,815
Feel free to sleep here tonight.

178
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,614
Um... My name is Fuu.

179
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,785
What's yours? What's your name?

180
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,830
My name is Okuru.

181
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,246
Is this your home?

182
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,125
For the time being.

183
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,046
I'm on a journey.

184
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,546
You've traveled alone the whole time?

185
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,797
Yes.

186
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,049
I'm all alone, too.

187
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,927
Those two jerks are gone now.

188
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,224
Those jerks?

189
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:11,056
Yeah. I used to have a couple of useless
bodyguards who were traveling with me.

190
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,314
Well, I guess it doesn't matter now.

191
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,941
Now I don't have anyone in the whole world.

192
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,399
That's why it doesn't matter if I
wind up dead in a ditch somewhere.

193
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,952
But I always hated the thought of drowning.

194
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,076
I mean, you can bloat up
to twice your size, right?

195
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,533
Forget that!

196
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,496
I wanna leave a beautiful corpse when I die.

197
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,801
In my old village, everyone was
taken by the Roaming God.

198
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,096
It's an infectious disease.

199
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,017
Everyone in the village... They all died of it.

200
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,482
I was away on a journey, so I alone survived.

201
00:19:55,569 --> 00:20:02,691
My wife and infant daughter
were taken by the gods, as well.

202
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,276
Oh...

203
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,159
Death leaves behind no beautiful corpses. None.

204
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,846
Good riddance to those two. Damn straight.

205
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,065
That little bitch...

206
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,365
Where will you go from here?

207
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,160
I have simply been heading westwards.

208
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,454
Westward...

209
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,248
I can't stay here for much longer.

210
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,704
I'm heading to the West, too. To Nagasaki.

211
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,632
I'm looking for a samurai
who smells of sunflowers.

212
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:07,797
Um... Would it be okay
if I went with you, Okuru?

213
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,313
Quit sneaking around out there. C'mon out.

214
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,732
I'll take you on whenever you're ready.

215
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,654
We 're police officers with the
Matsumae domain magistrate's office!

216
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,609
Come along peacefully, Okuru!

217
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,952
Give yourself up!

218
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,829
