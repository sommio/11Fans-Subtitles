1
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,150
I'm sorry, I need to borrow
your awning for a while.

2
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,653
You're a traveler, right? Please, come in.

3
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,577
Um... The thing is, I don't have any--

4
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,153
That's all right, don't worry about the money.

5
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:07,912
We love to hear travelers tell stories
about unfamiliar places here.

6
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,539
You don't need to stand on ceremony with us.

7
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,995
Okay, if you insist.

8
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,205
Many thanks.

9
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,714
Pops, give us some sake,
potatoes, and some oden stew.

10
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,510
I'm really sorry.

11
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:30,816
? Though a fool I may be in many ways, ?

12
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:41,994
? perhaps I may be rewarded for this deed. ?

13
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:52,375
? But alas, no new songs come to mind. ?

14
00:02:52,464 --> 00:03:02,510
? May I be allowed to sing to you instead ?

15
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:13,100
? the sad tale of Princess Kuzunoha? ?

16
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,113
That song makes me cry no
matter how many times I hear it.

17
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,784
There is something that I've heard.

18
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,739
They say that the songs of a goze are so sad

19
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,747
because they show the listener
things that he cannot see.

20
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,669
Goze?

21
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,463
A blind, traveling performer.

22
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,132
" Elegy of Entrapment, Verse 1
(Lamenting the Evils of the Times, Verse 1 )"

23
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,429
Come on, Mugen, he may have said to help
ourselves, but try showing some restraint.

24
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,684
I don't know the meaning of the word.

25
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,186
Well done.

26
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,356
Um... Your song was really great.

27
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,867
That song was a real downer.

28
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,865
It's a waste to see a fine lady
like you singing stuff like that.

29
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,241
Hey, watch it!

30
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,493
Have one on me.

31
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,450
I don't accept handouts from anyone.

32
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,660
I like your style.

33
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,121
That song made us cry like babies!

34
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,833
The thing is, did you know
that this area's our turf, lady?

35
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,419
We can't have a wandering goze set up
shop here without our permission.

36
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,550
Come on, say something!

37
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:31,726
Even if your eyes don't work, your
mouth oughta work just fine, moron!

38
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,976
Hey, leave her alone!

39
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,351
You got a problem?

40
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,604
It's all right.

41
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:43,610
I don't want anyone's sympathy
just because I'm blind.

42
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,065
Say what?

43
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,401
Sounds like she isn't taking us seriously.

44
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,704
Hey, do you want us to break your hand

45
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,533
so you'll never be able to
play the shamisen again?

46
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,616
Ow!

47
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,953
Do you want me to smash this mouth of yours

48
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,505
so you'll never be able to pick a fight again?

49
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,332
Bastard!

50
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,797
You forgot this!

51
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,509
Geez, those guys didn't put up a fight at all.

52
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,592
Excuse me...

53
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,930
Now, now. That wasn't sympathy,
I have ulterior motives.

54
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,311
What's your name?

55
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,858
My name is Sara.

56
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:25,656
I like you, lady. I like your face.
Your aggressiveness, too.

57
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,778
Ow...!

58
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,997
So, the three of you have been
traveling together all this way?

59
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,541
Well, it kinda worked out that way.

60
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,664
Where are you headed?

61
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:43,624
I'm going to Hyuga, which is
a little to the south of here.

62
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,210
Excuse me, Fuu?

63
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,466
I'm sorry for what I said.

64
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,891
You were only trying to be kind,
and I lashed out at you.

65
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,593
Oh, that?

66
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,351
I've been on my own for a long time,
so I've become a little sensitive and stubborn.

67
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,524
That's okay, I don't mind.

68
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,980
If it's all right with you, would you
like to join me until I reach Hyuga?

69
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:10,989
I'd like to repay you for your kindness.
I'll pay for our room and board.

70
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:37,687
? Unable to return to her fellow foxes... ?

71
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:52,153
?...the mother becomes a recluse
in the forests of Shinoda. ?

72
00:06:53,663 --> 00:07:04,130
? With her life now deprived of meaning, ?

73
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:14,887
? she calls out to her distant child,
"What shall I do?" ?

74
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:27,901
? Alas, what a sad tale this is! ?

75
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:55,382
? Hear my words, one and all. ?

76
00:07:55,475 --> 00:08:06,522
? Your health may suffer from
sitting and listening for so long... ?

77
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:20,658
?...and so I now bring this song to an end. ?

78
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,221
Geez, you two!

79
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,300
Taking advantage of someone's kind offer
is one thing, but this is ridiculous!

80
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,438
Well, I guess this is a lot
better than the times when we

81
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,767
fought tooth and nail over a single dumpling.

82
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:55,028
Forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn,
but isn't that a Kishibojin charm?

83
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,736
Hey, that's right! I've been
wondering about that, too.

84
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,741
Do you have a child?

85
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,665
Yes.

86
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,584
--The kid's dead?
--Hey, watch it!

87
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,414
No, my child is still alive.

88
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,467
So, is it with its father now?

89
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,591
The father is no longer around.

90
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,797
But then--

91
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:23,807
If a woman is blind,
she isn't fit to be a mother.

92
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,603
It's ironic, isn't it?

93
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,275
A woman like that singing a song
like " Kuzunoha Leaves her Child. "

94
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,196
Are we clear on this?

95
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,658
We have Sara to thank
for being able to stay here.

96
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,744
So don't get any funny ideas, got it?

97
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,124
Yes, ma'am...

98
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,504
We're in this one. You two use that one.

99
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,676
--Got it?
--Yes, ma'am...

100
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,630
--Not that one!
--Which one is it, then?

101
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,153
Mugen?

102
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,231
This isn't any fun.

103
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:22,490
You can't see me, so you don't
even let out a little scream.

104
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,411
How'd you know it was me?

105
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,493
Everyone has his own individual aura about him.

106
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,623
I can sense that.

107
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:39,343
I've walked in darkness for a long time.

108
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,639
But people can grow accustomed to anything.

109
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,389
Even if you can't see, you become
able to sense other things.

110
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,315
So I don't want you to feel sorry for me.

111
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,518
That's a load of crap.

112
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,982
Nobody who's happy could
sing that song of yours.

113
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,283
What do you think you're doing?!

114
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,285
I'm just taking a bath, that's all!

115
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,583
You're fooling around with Sara, aren't you?!

116
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,160
I am not!

117
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,291
Not yet, anyway...

118
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,919
Whatever, just get out of here!

119
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,423
What's the big deal? It ain't
like she can see anything.

120
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,219
Right?

121
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,390
Man, just when things were getting good...

122
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:29,719
Besides, it ain't like you got
anything up there that's worth hiding!

123
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:38,691
A-Are you okay? He didn't try anything, did he?

124
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,816
Can I ask you something?

125
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,994
What does Mugen look like?

126
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,571
What do you mean?

127
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:53,035
All I can see is my image of him in my head.

128
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,464
Y-You shouldn't waste
your time on a guy like him.

129
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,257
He's a complete toad!

130
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:06,432
Honestly, he's less than human.
He's more like a monkey or a gorilla.

131
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,633
What?

132
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,684
No, it's nothing.

133
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,976
Honestly, I swear...

134
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,438
I've never met a woman who has
her guard up as high as she does.

135
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,614
I like her even more now.

136
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,033
--You saw them?
--Saw what?

137
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,404
What do you want?

138
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,659
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,368
What was that all about?

140
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,458
And that's why I'm absolutely positive
that he's somewhere in Nagasaki.

141
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,295
The samurai who smells of sunflowers, I mean.

142
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,723
--Who is he?
--He's my father.

143
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,850
It's been so long since I last saw him
that I can barely remember him, though.

144
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,478
And when I meet him,
I'm gonna beat him senseless.

145
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,853
Oh.

146
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,357
What about you, Sara?

147
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,778
Is it a girl?

148
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,402
No, a boy.

149
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,404
Oh, a son, huh?

150
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,331
I know what you want to say.

151
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,535
But there's nothing that I can do about it.

152
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,712
No more than I can make my eyes see again.

153
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:29,430
Have you ever thought that you'd be
better off if you didn't reach Nagasaki?

154
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,348
N-No, why?

155
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:36,647
When you do, it will mean that
your journey will be over, right?

156
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:41,727
It's kinda eerie. It's like you're
seeing straight into my heart.

157
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:48,238
Because I can't see, my other
senses have become sharper.

158
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,116
Like scents. Or the sensation
of the air on my skin.

159
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,289
The auras of living things, that sort of thing.

160
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,915
Like that of your friend who is tucked
into the breast of your kimono, for instance.

161
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,463
That's amazing!

162
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,634
But one thing that I can't sense
is what people are feeling.

163
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,631
Which is the one that you don't want to leave?

164
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,808
W-What do you mean?

165
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:20,016
I-It's not like that...
We don't have that kind of relationship.

166
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,399
I don't know.

167
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:32,237
But I sometimes find myself thinking,
" I wish this journey could go on forever. "

168
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,039
But I know that isn't possible.

169
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,615
Oh.

170
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:43,455
What about you, Sara?
When will your journey end?

171
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,256
When I die, I suppose.

172
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,802
Because that is my lot in life.

173
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,925
It's my fate.

174
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,266
I wonder if we can reunite them...

175
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,848
Everyone has their own
problems to deal with in life.

176
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,685
People shouldn't meddle
in the affairs of others.

177
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,236
But they're a family!

178
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,235
Whatever happens, families are
always better off being together.

179
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,535
C'mon, now! C'mon!

180
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,863
C'mon!

181
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,573
Are you listening to me?

182
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,578
What did you pray for?

183
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,130
At the shrine back there.

184
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,082
For your son?

185
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:32,261
Actually, there is a favor that
I want to ask you about that.

186
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,802
" Festival "

187
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,447
I see. You wish to go see your son.

188
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:55,652
What, really? Man, I haven't had
a chance to do anything yet...

189
00:15:55,746 --> 00:16:01,662
I want you to pick something for me.
Something that a boy would like.

190
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,585
I don't know much about that stuff...

191
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,133
Hey, kid. Tell me what you'd wanna have.

192
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,007
Hm... Your sword!

193
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,714
I'm gonna chop you to pieces, kid!

194
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,767
Hey, tell us what we should get.

195
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,312
I want one of them to come with me.

196
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,112
Mugen or Jin. Either one.

197
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,453
Hey!

198
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,578
I wonder if he will like this...?

199
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,082
Beats me.

200
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:52,417
As far back as I can remember,
I never had any parents.

201
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,503
I wouldn't know.

202
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,596
You and I might be a lot alike.

203
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:05,430
I never knew the meaning
of the word "happiness. "

204
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:12,772
The closest I came was when my son was born,
and I had the same dreams as any mother.

205
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,033
Is something wrong?

206
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,500
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

207
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:30,250
It's just... Sorry.

208
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,547
Sara?

209
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,050
You understand, don't you?

210
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,391
That's the only life that is open to you.

211
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,976
Never forget that.

212
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,447
Aw, man...

213
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,372
Today's the last day we're gonna
be able to eat this great food?

214
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,449
Eat or speak, choose one.

215
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,284
I'm just sayin'...

216
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,339
Attention, please!

217
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,510
Jin... I want you to go with her.

218
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,762
Go with Sara.

219
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,469
Say what? More to the point, why not me?!

220
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,727
It'd be too dangerous for her
to be all alone with you!

221
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,603
And she's safe with this bozo?!

222
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,060
Jin would never do something like that.

223
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,522
Sara wants to live with her son.

224
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,906
But it sounds like there will be a lot
of difficulties standing in her way...

225
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,534
Anyway, I want you to do
all you can to help her.

226
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,667
Very well.

227
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,051
Thank you for everything
that you've done for me.

228
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,761
I hope we meet again.

229
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,598
Well then, be in good health.

230
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,568
Take care!

231
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,241
That bastard sure didn't put up much of a fight.

232
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,452
I can't believe it...

233
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:35,379
After we traveled together all this way,
how could he agree so easily...?

234
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:40,176
I thought that Jin was gonna say no!

235
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,422
But he didn't...!

236
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,052
I'd rather have gone with her, too!
Of all the stupid...

237
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,507
He didn't...!

238
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,014
Oh, shut up! Quit your crying!

239
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,562
Jin, you jerk!

240
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,546
Who hired you?

241
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,427
Someone that you and your
friends are no match for.

242
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:34,389
To tell you the truth, I don't want to do this.

243
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,394
But this was meant to be.

244
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,028
I see...

245
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,952
It seems that there is no need
to hold back against you.

246
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,746
You're definitely skilled enough
to have killed Enshiro Mariya.

247
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,456
What?!

248
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,065
What's going on...?

249
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,899
Can she see my movements?

250
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,279
It's not my eyes that can see them.

251
