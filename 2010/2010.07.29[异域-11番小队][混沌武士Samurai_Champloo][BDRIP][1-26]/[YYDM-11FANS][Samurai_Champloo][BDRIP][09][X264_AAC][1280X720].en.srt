1
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,511
Mr. Yamane.

2
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,467
So, this is where you've been?

3
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:47,180
Wow, it's hard to believe that Yamane
the Ogre is gonna be retiring today.

4
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,139
We'll miss you around here.

5
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,520
Starting tomorrow, I'll be just another old man.

6
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,945
I'll live out my years, waiting for death.

7
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,614
Still, it's pretty amazing...

8
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,909
I mean, you never let a single person get
away with sneaking through the checkpoint

9
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,454
in the 30 years that you've been here, right?

10
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,408
How long are you going to keep slacking off?

11
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,458
Get back to your post, or I'll--

12
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,038
Oops, there's that scary look... See you later.

13
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:20,547
I've worked here at the Hakone checkpoint
for thirty years, man and boy.

14
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,678
But even here, at this checkpoint
that was said to be impregnable,

15
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,808
there was one day that was an exception.

16
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:31,516
Even now, I remember as if it were yesterday...

17
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:37,196
That one day that isn 't recorded
here in the checkpoint log book...

18
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,742
On that day alone, everyone was
able to pass freely through here,

19
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,786
even thieves and criminals.

20
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,410
Everyone embraced whoever was next to him,

21
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,243
shouted at the top of
their lungs, beat the drums,

22
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,171
and danced, letting themselves go.

23
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:59,468
Yes, it's been thirty years now...

24
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,556
A travel permit? What's that?

25
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,141
You really don't know?

26
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,648
I'm amazed that you managed to
get into Edo without knowing that.

27
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,525
If you don't have a travel permit,
they won't let you through the checkpoint.

28
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,981
Don't you have one, Jin?

29
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,067
I did, of course.

30
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,947
--But...
--But?

31
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,528
I lost it.

32
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,703
You bozos...

33
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,577
Don't sweat it.

34
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,535
If they stop us at the checkpoint,
we kill 'em, that's all.

35
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,086
Breaking through a checkpoint is
punishable by death on the spot.

36
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:39,542
And Hakone's in particular is known for
being extremely difficult to get through.

37
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,469
Especially for women who are leaving Edo.

38
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,841
What're we gonna do?

39
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,550
Hey, there, buddies. If it's travel
permits you need, I have 'em.

40
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,885
I have 'em, and they can be yours for a song!

41
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,266
Permits? You mean for the checkpoint?

42
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,642
--You bet.
--Really?

43
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,226
And if you act now, I'll even throw in
these good luck charms for traffic safety.

44
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,981
It's a steal!

45
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:04,362
" Hakone Checkpoint"

46
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,078
Arrest them!

47
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,418
What? What's going on?

48
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,212
What's the problem?! We got permits, don't we?!

49
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,632
These things are blatant forgeries.

50
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:25,088
Did you seriously think you could pass through
the Hakone checkpoint with these things?

51
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,389
That damn scalper is gonna pay...

52
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,012
Take 'em away!

53
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,682
That was the first time that I saw them.

54
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:42,864
That was back when I was still a footman.
I had just started as a government official.

55
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:50,492
Yes, those were the
flashing eyes of a stray dog...

56
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,207
" Beatbox Bandits (Evil Mountain Spirits) "

57
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,208
Come on, take off everything, even your kimono.

58
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,382
It's bad enough that you caught us,
so why do I have to do this, too?

59
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,757
Because you might be hiding
some kind of contraband.

60
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,836
That doesn't mean you can--

61
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:12,598
If you want, we could also do a cavity search
instead of just having you strip down.

62
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:25,193
Take a good look! You'll be
joining those guys soon enough!

63
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,446
This is Kinugusa, the top official
here at the checkpoint.

64
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,450
He's a stereotypical government lapdog.
A man who's rotten to the core.

65
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:38,411
But because his father has a lot of clout
in Edo, no one complains about him.

66
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,666
Watch it, that's cold...

67
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:50,848
With an attitude like that, I won't be able
to be nice and pretend I didn't see you.

68
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,767
What? Are you serious?
How could that have happened?

69
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,142
So which one has the bounty on
his head? Which one? Who is it?

70
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,563
This happens every once in a while.

71
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,892
When we catch someone trying to sneak
through who has a criminal record,

72
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,524
if it was a violent crime, we have to escort him

73
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:09,449
to the place that issued the warrant
instead of executing him at the checkpoint.

74
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:14,747
That's why we 're supposed to do a thorough
check before they're publicly crucified.

75
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:21,580
But this man enjoyed killing people
too much to bother to do that.

76
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,958
Bingo!

77
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,587
Damn, we already killed him...

78
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,589
What am I gonna do?
This is seriously bad news...

79
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,467
I gotta think of a way to smooth
this over by the end of the day...

80
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,139
--Excuse me, sir...
--What is it?

81
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,512
I'm in a bad mood right now, so ask me later.

82
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,220
I have an idea.

83
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,772
Oh, okay... That would work.

84
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:45,353
Bring me those two men and
the girl who was with them!

85
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,359
As I understand it, someone
gave you those forgeries,

86
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,816
and you unwittingly tried to
pass through here with them.

87
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,324
Public crucifixion would be
too harsh a sentence for that.

88
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,827
That being the case, I'm willing to spare you.

89
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,081
But only on one condition.

90
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,372
I want you to deliver this
head before the day is out.

91
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,834
Understand? These two are hostages.

92
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,888
If you complete your task and return by sunset,

93
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:17,138
I'll let the three of you
through the checkpoint.

94
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,892
But if you don't, these two are as good as dead.

95
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,393
You understand that, right?

96
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,476
Make absolutely sure you
come back in time, okay?

97
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,562
No problem, it's a piece of cake!
Just leave it to me.

98
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,443
Before the sun goes down, okay?

99
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,696
So, what's this I hear about
Tengu roaming these mountains?

100
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,279
They are said to be a grotesque people
that are terrifying to look upon.

101
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,535
They attack with the speed of the wind,

102
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,460
and not a single man has seen
them and lived to tell the tale.

103
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:49,416
No one dares to go near that mountain
these days, not postmen, and not footmen.

104
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,254
--See ya!
--We can trust you on this, right?

105
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,430
Hey, what are you waiting for?

106
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,133
Go keep an eye on him to
make sure he doesn't run away!

107
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:02,722
You don't think he'd abandon
us and run away, do you?

108
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,352
Hmm...

109
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,067
One's on my tail, huh?

110
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,383
Who are you?

111
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,555
Who, me? I'm out jogging for
my health. Is there a problem?

112
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,224
Son of a...

113
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,393
Don't confuse me like that, damn it!

114
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,808
Being assigned to watch over
him wasn't part of the plan...

115
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,895
I guess even stupid officials are smart
enough to cover their own asses...

116
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,605
Oops!

117
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,959
This time, I know they're following me...

118
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,979
There you are, you Tengu bastards...
Think you can keep up with me?!

119
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,922
Huh?

120
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,209
Where am I?

121
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,681
You don't think he got lost
or something, do you?

122
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,474
Hmm...

123
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,865
What the hell is this?

124
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,000
Ow...

125
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,387
You don't think he got captured
by the Tengu or something, do you?

126
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,059
Hmm...

127
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,899
Where did he go...?

128
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,550
Tengu?

129
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,974
No... They're warrior priests!

130
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,473
So that's what the Tengu really are!

131
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,600
These are peaceful times, where the
famines of the past are long gone,

132
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,228
along with the uprisings that went with them.

133
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,026
Warrior priests were thought to have
disappeared into the shadows of history.

134
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,025
I can 't believe that they've
survived in this form...

135
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:50,248
There are only two kinds of dogs
in this world, do you hear me?

136
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,372
And those are stray dogs and pet dogs.

137
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,500
Stray dogs, which, in exchange for freedom,

138
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,674
wander in the rain and eat
the food of uncertainty.

139
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:06,223
Or pet dogs, which wear a collar and do
nothing but eat the food of subjugation.

140
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,176
So tell me, which kind of dog are you?!

141
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,017
That's right.

142
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,851
The ones who run this country now are
stupid samurai who indulge in indolence

143
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:22,906
and are interested in nothing
but maintaining their power!

144
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:29,488
Them, and their pet dogs who never question
those samurai and simply do as they're told!

145
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,699
And so, we do not recognize
the legitimacy of their rule!

146
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,500
We will take back this
country from those people

147
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:39,456
who are good for nothing but waving
their swords around and killing people!

148
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:49,474
But our battle is one which will
make fighting itself a thing of the past.

149
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,178
And that grass which erases all hatred,

150
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:58,438
the grass we are creating in
our fields, has grown plentiful.

151
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:03,818
But there are those who would
try to stop our revolution!

152
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,991
And to those people, we will show no mercy!

153
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:12,243
If they want to crush us, they'd better
be prepared to pay with their lives!

154
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:20,456
And today, another such interloper
has appeared and has been captured.

155
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,386
You don't look like one of
the Shogunate's dogs, though.

156
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,058
Who are you?

157
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,261
What's the matter?

158
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:40,396
Are you a coward who's too scared to say
anything if his sword is taken away from him?

159
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,775
That stuff you said just now,
I didn't understand a damn word of it.

160
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,323
I see you at least have some spunk.

161
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,948
But there's one thing that I do understand.

162
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,531
It don't matter how many dogs you got here

163
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,618
if they don't have enough courage
to bark when they're by themselves.

164
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,634
That's a good boy... You're an
interesting doggie, aren't you?

165
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,214
Perhaps I'll show you a shortcut on the path
to the Amida Buddha's Western Paradise.

166
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:15,928
Listen up! We're gonna execute
this guy in grand style tomorrow!

167
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,612
We'll bury you with that head tomorrow.

168
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,566
Do your best to rest in peace, all right?

169
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,331
Everything in me says that I should run away.

170
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,958
But...

171
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,539
I don't know what it was...

172
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:50,755
I couldn't stop thinking about him.
About that stray dog.

173
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:57,352
Hey, are you alive? Hello?

174
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:09,231
You don't think he was caught a long time ago
and is tied up in a straw mat now, do you?

175
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,906
Hmm...

176
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,577
We'll execute both of you tomorrow.

177
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,872
So try to get along until then, all right?

178
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,457
I could swear I've seen you before...

179
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,756
You have. I'm an official
from the Hakone checkpoint.

180
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,458
What the hell are you doing here, then?

181
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:33,343
I've been following you ever since you left
to make sure that you didn't escape.

182
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,889
Keep up the good work.

183
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,013
Yeah, tell me about it.

184
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,436
Who the hell are these guys?

185
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,356
A bunch of warrior priests
that time left behind.

186
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,434
--Warrior priests?
--Yes.

187
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:50,488
There was a time when the priests of a temple
would take up arms and fight for the people.

188
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:55,695
But with the country at peace like it is now,
nobody wants people like that anymore.

189
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:02,034
But in spite of that, they still think they
can change the country all by themselves.

190
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,335
What a bunch of morons...

191
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,128
That's for sure...

192
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,634
Agile little guy, ain't ya?

193
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,932
It's a little trick I can do.

194
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,394
Let me borrow this.

195
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,443
Hey, what're you doing?

196
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,144
Hey!

197
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,154
Sorry, friend, but we need your help.

198
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,410
Nanmaida...

199
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,585
Fire! There's a fire!

200
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,957
We're gonna burn alive!

201
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,171
Oh, no!

202
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,433
What's going on?

203
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,184
There a fire in the storehouse!
It'll spread if we don't act fast!

204
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,434
There's a what?!

205
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,393
Fire! There's a fire!

206
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,372
I see that you can't bring
yourself to wait until tomorrow.

207
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,200
That's all right, we'll make
a change in plans for you.

208
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,127
We'll reschedule your
execution and kill you right now.

209
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,375
Hey. Get down.

210
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,801
What the--?

211
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,305
--Damn it, where are they?!
--Where'd they go?!

212
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,683
--Find them!
--Where are they?!

213
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,899
--T-The field!
--The field is catching fire!

214
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,858
Our crop...! Our revolution!

215
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:04,118
You bastards, do you have any
idea what you've just done?!

216
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:12,915
You've destroyed our holy grass with your...

217
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,532
Well, it's almost time.

218
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,360
He ran away, huh?

219
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,912
He wouldn't...! Please, wait a little longer!

220
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,615
Come on, he might be right
over the horizon as we speak!

221
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,621
Right?

222
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:53,500
Well, I guess it's about time
you started saying your prayers.

223
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,048
Look! Someone's coming!

224
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,507
Mugen...

225
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,685
I knew it... I knew you'd come!

226
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,522
Who are you?

227
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:24,987
Who, me? I'm just out jogging
for my health. Is there a problem?

228
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,003
And without further ado...
Time for your execution.

229
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,626
You gotta be kidding me!

230
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,504
If you're gonna come back and
haunt someone, haunt your friend.

231
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,891
"Weak spot here"
" Poop "

232
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:02,486
Yes... On that night,
everyone loved one another.

233
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,567
The gates of the checkpoint were thrown open,

234
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:08,951
and everyone became equals, be they
government officials, thieves, or even animals.

235
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,454
Everyone went on dancing until morning came.

236
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,163
Yes, a revolution happened there, all right.

237
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,748
For just one night.

238
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,971
What do you suppose
happened back there, anyway?

239
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,970
We should just be grateful that we were able
to cross the checkpoint in the confusion.

240
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,347
I can't believe that Mugen...

241
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:35,978
Not only didn't he come back by sundown,
it's morning and he still hasn't shown up.

242
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,946
Wow, that was fun!

243
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,029
Yeah, but it's all gone up in smoke!

244
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,491
Don't sweat it, buddy!

245
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,417
Yay!

246
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,335
You jerk!

247
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,339
Everyone went on dancing, as if in a dream.

248
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:13,724
And then, the whole incident vanished
like the morning mist and was forgotten.

249
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:22,566
You proud stray dog, do you still remember?

250
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,147
Do you remember that summer of love,

251
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:30,362
in which you ran and danced
and fought in the purple haze?

252
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,156
Just kidding!

253
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:39,579
