1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,545
Come on, let me have some more fun with you!

2
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,342
Bastard...

3
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,395
" Evanescent Encounter (Part 3)
(The Cycle of Death and Rebirth, Part 3) "

4
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,828
Shit...

5
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,430
I'm gonna teach you how we felt...

6
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,265
...when we had to live in disgrace.

7
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,776
I'm going to ruin your life.

8
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,524
Just like you ruined ours!

9
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,541
Who's there?

10
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:37,883
Um... Are you Seizo Kasumi?

11
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,969
No, I'm not.

12
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,475
This is no place for a young lady
like you. You should go home.

13
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,903
I came here to see someone.

14
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,575
I came from so far away to see him...

15
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,784
Wait a minute, are you--

16
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,866
Wait here a moment.

17
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,390
Careful, now!

18
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:28,346
I can't have you croaking on me that easily.

19
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,021
And now I'm going to teach you your lesson.

20
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:39,482
I'm gonna teach you how it feels to be
disgraced, and yet have to go on living.

21
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,788
What a load of crap...

22
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:52,878
I've lived with every kind
of disgrace you can think of.

23
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,832
There ain't one damn thing
that you can possibly teach me!

24
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,713
You want me to have a taste of how
you feel? Quit talking like a pussy!

25
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:08,303
When you point a sword at somebody,
you kill them or they kill you. End of story.

26
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:13,266
I don't wanna hear any bitching from
somebody who can't deal with that!

27
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,972
Hey, that was dirty, keeping
a dagger hidden in there!

28
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:54,227
Aw, man... So much for my ace in the hole.

29
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,981
Is someone here?

30
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:10,289
Yes. A young girl who says that she has
traveled a great distance to see you, Seizo.

31
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,414
What would you like me to do?
If you like, I can have her come back later.

32
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:19,999
No, that's all right. Send her in.

33
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,854
I'm sorry, you'll have to
forgive me for not getting up.

34
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,690
Who might you be?

35
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:49,119
I'm sorry, but my eyes
can't see much these days.

36
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:57,708
Ever since I was a little girl,
my mother and I lived by ourselves.

37
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:03,759
I had always been told that
my father had died long ago.

38
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,712
But that wasn't true.

39
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:11,676
He was alive, and he had
abandoned Mother and me.

40
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,349
That's what Mother told me when she lay dying.

41
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:23,904
Even now, when people ask me about
my father, I say that I don't have one.

42
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,357
I don't consider myself his daughter.

43
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:32,037
Even if I met him, I wouldn't want
to hear any excuses from him.

44
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,705
I'll never be able to
forgive him for what he did.

45
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:48,054
I'm sure that he doesn't know about how
we suffered or how Mother got sick and died.

46
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,554
That's why I swore that when I met him,
I would make sure that he understood.

47
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:57,513
That when I met him, I would
belt him one, no matter what.

48
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,643
That's what I had planned, but now...

49
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:08,612
This isn't fair... I can't do anything to you.
Not when you're so sick.

50
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,366
Fuu...

51
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,346
I don't think we'll see each other again.

52
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,634
Goodbye.

53
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,488
God, please hear my prayer...

54
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,788
Once is all I ask.

55
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,339
When I grow up, please let
me meet my father someday.

56
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:53,470
As I suspected, you must be Seizo's daughter.

57
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:58,016
He's talked about you a great deal.

58
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,391
Seizo has always been...

59
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,687
W-Who are you?

60
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,121
--Wait!
--Don't!

61
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,671
Let go!

62
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,240
Seizo Kasumi, I presume?

63
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,697
I am Guard Captain Kagetoki Kariya.

64
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:07,707
By order of the Shogun,
I have come to take your life.

65
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:12,712
Cut away. I'm as good as dead already.

66
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,008
Do you have any last words?

67
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,635
Fuu.

68
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,683
I have no right to ask for your forgiveness.

69
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:32,771
But a day hasn't gone by when I haven't
thought of you and your mother.

70
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,360
I'm sorry.

71
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,409
Come out here!

72
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:29,038
After killing Kasumi, my orders are to
eliminate all family members and retainers.

73
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,422
W-Wait a minute!

74
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,648
That hurt, damn it!

75
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,817
You don't know when to quit!

76
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,705
You wanna play hide and seek again?

77
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,295
Are you ready?

78
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,341
No, not yet!

79
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,071
Found ya!

80
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,910
This ends here!

81
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,680
You're pissing me off!

82
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,407
Mugen...!

83
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:36,081
You have my gratitude for leading me here.

84
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:44,094
If you are truly the daughter of a samurai,
choose to die a brave death.

85
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,122
Y-You son of a...

86
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,422
Jin!

87
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,516
You have my compliments.

88
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,229
You managed to save your life
by somehow avoiding a fatal blow.

89
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:49,034
In your current condition,
though, you can't hope to best me.

90
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,701
Why are you here?

91
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,576
Are you trying to throw away the life
that you so narrowly managed to keep?

92
00:13:54,667 --> 00:14:00,333
There are no lords worth risking your life for.
As I recall, that's what you said.

93
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:06,760
Yes... For my whole life,
I've fought only for myself.

94
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:12,341
My study of the sword was for no one but myself.

95
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,971
But now...

96
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,226
This is the last lesson
that I have to teach you.

97
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,309
That lesson is the one
and only way to kill an enemy

98
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,519
that you have no hope of winning against.

99
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:30,200
You probably won't defeat him, but it is
possible that you will take him with you.

100
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,199
You leave a small opening in your
defense and allow yourself to be struck.

101
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,624
When that happens, it will create a brief
opening, and that is when you strike.

102
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,420
Your chances of survival are virtually zero.

103
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:48,343
If at all possible,
don't ever use this technique.

104
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,556
I swear, I always get the
short end of the stick...

105
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,984
You bastard...

106
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,862
Jin!

107
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:58,413
I can't believe it...
You allowed yourself to be struck...

108
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,755
Mugen!

109
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,139
What, it's you guys again?

110
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,182
I can't move anymore.

111
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:30,236
I think this might really be my time to go...

112
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,209
Mugen?

113
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,881
Mugen! Mugen!

114
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,338
You're alive...!

115
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:02,803
Oh, it's you? I thought you
were Death for a second...

116
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,889
It seems like all I ever do is cry.

117
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,770
And here I was trying to make it on my own...

118
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,146
You dumb broad...

119
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,733
Did you meet the Sunflower Samurai?

120
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,370
You did, huh...?

121
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:35,423
A promise is a promise.
Now it's time to settle things with you.

122
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,253
So it would seem.

123
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,277
Ain't we a sorry sight...

124
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,903
You can say that again.

125
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:17,920
The truth is, Seizo wanted to bring
you and your mother with him.

126
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:24,180
But if he had, you would have been hounded
by the Shogunate's Christian hunts, too.

127
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,932
That's why he came here by himself.

128
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:35,070
The picture I had of my father in my
memories was of a big and strong man.

129
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:39,741
But when I actually met him,
he wasn't anything like that.

130
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,820
He was really small and frail.

131
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:49,204
But I still sensed that he really was my father.

132
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,833
Are you awake?

133
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,463
Yeah...

134
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,513
It would seem that this isn't Hell...

135
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,842
This feels so weird...

136
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:10,600
Up until now, whenever I met
somebody who was tougher than me,

137
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,774
I couldn't rest until I'd killed the guy.

138
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,271
But now...

139
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:20,357
I don't feel like killin' you at all.

140
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:26,196
I, too, feel as if I've finally found what
I've been searching for all this time.

141
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,743
I have been alone my entire life...

142
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,499
You are the first friends I have ever made.

143
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,582
Hey, you two are awake!

144
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,842
You've certainly gotten a lot of sleep.
You've been out for nearly a whole week.

145
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,468
We have...?

146
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,800
I'm starving... Gimme something to eat.

147
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,656
Well, see ya.

148
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,081
Until we meet again.

149
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:16,208
Um, listen... There's something
that I haven't told you.

150
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,583
As in?

151
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:21,839
Way back when we started this trip,
we made a bet, remember?

152
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,764
Toss this coin, and if it comes up heads,
hack away all you want.

153
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:30,764
But if it comes up tails,
both of you will stay with me.

154
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,686
Are we clear?

155
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,853
It's tails!

156
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,058
The thing is... It actually came up heads.

157
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,269
--Say what?!
--You didn't...!

158
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,819
That's all.

159
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,822
She had us completely fooled.

160
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,525
What did we even come on this trip for?

161
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,699
Well, bye! I hope we meet again!

162
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,226
Yeah, good morning!
I wake up alone beneath my down covers

163
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,929
And drop the record needle onto another new life

164
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:21,277
The streetlights that still burn dimly are a
guideline that's a restlessly ticking hour hand

165
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,943
Boredom is a bunch of facts,
scenery I've seen once

166
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,946
Actors and actresses looking back on the past

167
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:31,154
I wouldn 't miss it for the world

168
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:57,142
Get up, get up!
Walking, sleeping, keep on movin ' slowly

169
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:01,693
Good morning and good sunshine

170
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,521
The borderlines that blur
from midnight to morning

171
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,027
Are individuals looking for different answers

172
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,869
The cycle that walks around the Earth
is the sun beyond that white line

173
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,114
Isn 't there something missing?
Something I don 't understand?

174
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:19,915
Uncertain, I go off in search of them,
and found myself playing in my bare feet

175
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,371
And the night wakes up once again

176
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,548
From dawn to dusk, hello!

177
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,043
Wanna melt down this totally
outrageous darkness?

178
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:32,970
The moon 's jasmine jumps across the
faintly moving sky, lands, and goodnight

179
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,954
Get up, get up! Walking...

180
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,168
Sleeping, keep on movin'...

181
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,298
Get up, get up! Walking...

182
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,261
Sleeping, keep on movin'...

183
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:20,471
"The End "
